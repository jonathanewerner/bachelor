the sachs is really strange
you asked people
david activity
and if you ask people particularly
college students
critically at this
spring break
i've seen the movies
comp
though all the matter
sex or some
word that is anonymous sex
what
there's a camilla puzzle
about how much time we spend on sex
time so there's data on
so people say sexist or favored activity
but it turns out we actually know
how much time average american spends
on sex
and
they didn't wanna follow promise some rise by this witness wonderful book by james polite
tom
action
americans tell pulitzer single favored activity is sex
in terms of enjoy ability
they rang sex ahead of us
sports
fishing bar hopping
hugging kissing
talking with the family
eating
watching tv going on trips
planning trips gardening
bathing shopping dressing house workers watching laundry
visiting advances in gettin' the car repair
on the other hand
this same studies suggested the average time her day devoted to sex
it is
four minutes and three seconds
oh
as like says
not much
even at the four minutes is the explodes
time
then flirting
dancing
i'm doing
cruising double apart
toni up in jams tony up and beauty bars
rehearsing pick up winds
shower and
king about sex reading about sex
brutally pornographic late
i
looking at erotic mag
teens
renting videos dreaming of sex
looking at fashion magazines cleaning up after sex
coping with the consequences of sex
building towers
or otherwise were pressing transferring
and so blow mating
ed
i like this passage
because it illustrates two points
one point
one is we don't actually is
spend that much time on set
in fact a four minutes in three seconds news resting number
because
when you and when you do time studies
how much americans
ben
filling out
we're late informs
for it i arrest
it's four minutes in a few zack
wrong
but
the passage also points at that regardless of the brute time we spend on it
it is six
if ordinarily important
on everything
unlike follows from
marriage
family
children
much of aggression
much of competition
much of art and music and creative pursuits
much of everything follows from that
if we were creature without sacks
everything would be different
and
was interesting is
there are creatures without sex
there are creatures that reproduced by cloning
and in fact
this basic fact about people
that we fall roughly in the males and females
is a evolutionary nest
it's not clear why animals that are somewhat lard
from a pub while logical darwin the in perspective
adding to sex is is bizarre
his each time you have an offspring you toss away happy jeans
my children only adaptation have half
maybe in may
if i was to clone
they would have all of it
and so it's a puzzle have sex ever fall
this is not a course in evolutionary biology and that's not the puzzle will be looking at today
well that
if your question
first let's talk
from forces theoretical pointed view
and then durable poignant you
about how
males and females are different
then let's talk about sexual attractive mess
some research of a what people find
to be sexually attractive
and also a very well that dan
but origins of sexual preference why some people worst
great
others day
others by sexual
others harder to classified
mom
now
of all the topics on presenting sex is one of the sort of
the icy winds
from an emotional point of view
these are difficult issue
because sex is
by definition an intimate part of our lives
and then it matters a lot
moreover sexist fraught will moral implication
and says i'm talking about this from
at least the beginning
from a dar within evolutionary perspective
mom
i'm obliged to struck by dealing with some of the moral consequences and moral implications
so for instance
many a biology us
all biology is i would say what are you
that on
that
sexual behavior sexual action sexual desire
this is some extent a biological adaptation existing to spread our genes
from that perspective than
non crow creative sex
including on
gay sex
sex with birth control
sex bright post menopause for women
i'm does not
sir this reproductive goal
and in some sense wraps
is unnatural
and one might are you then
does this mean it's wrong
we'll also be talking about sex
differences between men and women for instance
yeah non
and how much you want anonymous
sexual encounters
differences between men and women
in social intelligence
in aggression empathy
and
regardless of what you think about
these
the defense says
when you think they're right or wrong are doesn't matter
you asked a question to what extent are amiable
that is
they exist
you are we a natural selection
to what extent calm
can we ever get rid of
i wanna address those two issues issues of morality
in enacted ability
bomb
from the very start
and i wanna start off with
bomb
look for each of them have a quarrel
by a prominent evolutionary it's
scholars of the first one
by steve thinker
and how the mind works
in the rights
nature does not dictate what we should accept the how which live our lives
well into micro pro kuwaiti years i am so far voluntarily trial us
having swan earn my biological resources reading and writing doing research
helping of friends and students and jogging in circles
ignoring the solemn dared to spread my jeans
by their way in standards i am horrible mistake a pathetic loser
but i'm happy to be that way of my genes don't like it they can go jump in the lake
if this point i think is a reasonable one
ah
it is true
that certain things we do
exist to serve the dictates of natural selection
but that doesn't make them right
ah if you think that something is only right
if it needs a new generation of more
jeans
if it leads to reproduction
can you not that i think very much about birth control
ah
you not to nothing very much about any sort of non crow created sacks
on the other hand if you're
moreover if you think something's wrong
if it's to it it's unnatural
you not that i think much about
flying a plane
or refer to raiding food
or surviving severe infection
you are generally our bodies and brains have evolved reproductive success
that we can use these brains shoes are own destiny is
nothing moral necessarily follows the facts of biology
that's almost a boat more hour
but i want you to keep in mind when we discussed
different claims were what's of all what
hasn't
what about inhabited villages
i'm here i wanna turned to richard docked
richard audience race
the trial us had bad
teaching in mathematics and the six
the resulting deficiency can be remedy
by extra good teaching in the following year
but any suggestion of a trials efficiency may have a genetic origin
is likely to be greeted with something approaching this
there
cindy genes is it
contents
and nothing can be done about it
this is furnishes nonsense on an almost pathological scale
genetic causes environmental cause or principal no difference
from each other
some may be hard to the reverse others may be easy
one in jeans what it used to it to deserve their sinister drug or not like reputation
why hurricane thought to be so much more dixon in this capable winner facts
television nuns are books
i like the nuns pomp
and it
only areas
what causes something
is logically separate
from what can reverse it
anne
you think of clear cases
we're something is plainly jeanette
what is fairly easily reversed
or something is cultural
and is very difficult to reverse
here's an example
by side is quite pour
the reason why my sight is played for
is not do
tuna page the artie
television culture are the man
rather
my i said is quite war
you look happy jeans
mom and dad gave his genetically determined if anything is
it is also
fairly easy defects
thirties mush
jeanne
how
where to put pains of glass
cried your eyes
and helping to see that
more defense machine jonas consequences actually stick dipping into your eyes
and at the cost of occasional infections
you are too
you become to see that
it is why logically
cops
but fairly easy defects
on the other hand stake in example of
science treatment of those weeks
it turns out when we and we will get us a little that without that sexual practice
healthy and somebody is
or how bad they are
what you think of that is actually
not critically hard wired the varies a lot from culture to culture
the ones is inappropriate is almost impossible to shh
so the point there is just that
genetic does not mean inevitable
and
cultural does not mean easy defects
okay
that general backed up
let's start with basic sex that
was it your country males and females
well
don't even think
penis under john
ah there's a lot of animals that had neither one
and it was actually runs deeper
by definition
when well that just talk about this
calm
animals that are males
have a little sex sells
carries jeans and nothing else
sperm cells
animals that are females have a good sex out
on which has jeez
but also for loaded with active cover and all sorts of others
typically
the little sex sell isn't much murmured in a big sex up
this is the only erotic picture and show you today
if the budget will sperm
going around
hey
it's romantic
calm
with this raises a paul hall
i just described nail of female
roughly in terms of the size different
males are smaller
i'd sex sells
females are they there
why is it then
so many animals
males
art a bigger wants
physically
and more aggressive wants
this is that a puzzle as occupied scientists
for a long long time
and
we're pretty that there is now
a pretty clear answer to it
and that's it goes like this
is this an idea
by robert troopers
call parental investments
and what parental investment is
fine here as
any investments
that's been increased
dobbs
green's chance of survival
cos of the parents
ability to invest
in other option
so for example
suppose a mound will create mockery
by blinking an eye
and in often the run off
that'd be extremely little invest
suppose another animal had to work for ten years
and during those ten years
could not create another ox
that'd be a huge investment
traversed points out
that would be in a species
females
typically have a much higher parental investment
then males
mom
because females have
typically the bacon internally
carry them
if their eggs are made up to sit on them
and
hence each potential child
is achieved
for medals
which have a small sets up
you don't have the same sec
for males
mom
it might just be
few moments of a population
and that's that
a. b. that after so
humans
each one of you in a rome
what is the minimum
you can do
to create a trial
as happy jeans
and as a pattern
that the male investment on average is lower
then the female basement males can shoes
or might you better off than some circumstances
putting a lot of investment in her off
run
but females don't have a choice
females barring technological advance
have a huge investment into any off great
i'm not investment in the sense of hard work an effort
to
i'm investment in the sense that one year when you
the jest when when you're hiding
when you're pregnant wolf one offspring you can have
another
what this does
is it has ramifications of perky laid out for us
so
italy two different psychology
males
a single melted fertilizer bomb been else
forcing some males to go mae west
and giving rise
competition
to see who could mabel the most be mounts
for females
however females can always find mate
so sheer numbers don't caps
a lot
this competition to mate with a right
males
those is offering have the best chance
of survival
wrong
the competition
now explains the puzzle we started explains why males
we larger
and often one males of a vaults
for weapons
the special weapons of all
fighting other males
for reproductive access
it also explain something else
females
why logically or choose a
and so males happened paid not merely of other males
two on
to to to get reproductive access
but also to wolf ina
and so often males have a ball special displays
right
yes
which exist
only
to be beautiful
only to be attractive
and to attract
makes
tom
cole evolutionary logic was captured
in this courtroom
i wish
whoa
really that's a mob a hundred years
of mate selection research
the logic
goes like this then
difference in the size of sex sells
lisa difference isn't typical parental best man
leading the differences in the sorts of psychological and physiological mechanisms of op
okay that's a good story
what sort of evidence is there for
well it turns out this could explain some otherwise surprising thanks
for instance
there should be there are some cases
order parental investment is switch
some cases where turns a werner males
and out with more investment
then the females
and it then
the theory projects
tom
that in these cases you should get an a. symmetry
so in cases like pipe fish for instance
the male takes the eggs
into apparel
and plugs them into his blood string
the females shoe ra
they have less of an investment in the mets
in this case
you would project
as a stroke
females
should be larger
females fight
other females more than males right males
females
try to compete for the tension of the males
carl
the movie march of the penguins
we saw a clip from it
and this was in the context of discussing the emotions
that above all
ford's are off
but remember the story
and how both male and female have to do tremendous lengths
to protect eck
and one of them fails day dives in the the one has a
you should then not even have to remember
whether male females are much bigger
then female things
you should realize
should not be in in fact they are
there but the same size
because if the parental investment
is equal
you should be able to project this size differences and aggression differences
based on differing parental investments
so for a sense
tom elephant seals
fort winding males are enormous
four times bigger than a female
this isn't large part
because elephant seals compete for hiram son females
is a winner take all
get them started the same size
and is it because gibbons are pretty monotonous to raise children
together
this illustrate something
which is is not always the case
ah
that male parental investment
is law
there are some species including get there
where
it's in the males reproductive advantage secure perk off
imagine a situation for instance work
i'm off
bring would die
both parents didn't want it for many years
and
where
devoted said offering have to be exclusive
if you focus on another family or when away
the offering would die
in that case you had people
investment
it would madame equally to the male and female
to invest in their offspring and the cost
would be the same
there's no species
hard as a species that i bet
much of an evil system
but some cry mace or close to it
in this raises the question then
what about humans
what about us
what are we know about the differences between
males and females
well
on humans
are relatively bullet in the species
most cultures
most human cultures
are on
a witness
american culture
is what they call cereal monopoly
so we're not like some species of birds widow made for life
we do this year's appear bombings
for some period of time i could be for life
but indeed not be in usually isn't
males are bigger and females
human males to size estimates vary so much
the average human else but fifteen percent
larger in the average human being not
this suggest that person may there's been
in our evolutionary history
some male male competition
bomb
for access to females
which suggests intern
the parental investment is not quite equal
tom males have smaller testicles
for their body size
then chimp and seized
a larger testicles
the new rosen gibbons
tom
and this suggested a was
some intermediate amount of competition
for the past me
creates
and this is relevant for different sort of competition
which regards him craig nation of
females have multiple mates
in this ingested or revolutionary history
women were not wanton leigh
promiscuous but we're not harley monopoly
so much so that that it paid from evolutionary point of view
you dual fault males to all the capacity to produce more networks
stern
other males
aggression males are nina
freddie and some arising here meters lot of technical term
females can be meter but males
art is more
physically violence
they're more violent
in the wound in your role
they're more violent as such
over and
enter more violent as adults
tom again
this is not to say that you can find violent women
or non violent man
dishes on average
there is is difference
tom
more
males cake more
in the u. s.
i'm as children to mourn balkan play fighting in violent
combat like sports
and as adults
wherever you go you will find a prison
and wherever you go you will find that prison is mostly philip
full of men
and therefore more likely
one another
and a harmon other
mom
male sex hormones
your own
are the sort not the sort of thing one would one reject and somebody
unless you want them to turn
kind envy
they increase aggressive nest
o. think humans
and another product
what about sexual choose the next
two male humans and female humans differ
in the extent to which
they will
favor anonymous sex
and
this is relevant from an evolutionary perspective
because the parental investment theory predicts males
should be more receptive to anonymous sex
because
calm
for males
tune prayed nate somebody else
might
for choice leave lead to another off
it might be good for you
and doesn't carry
the sort of harm
that females another unhappy very hickey
because they have to choose
careful
remember the systems of all for birth
for all
and the second knees and somehow
so what we know crossed cultural late
and psychological well
prostitution
is the universally
me or near universally
male
ah been dressed
there are male prostitutes of course
but contrary to some
various fantasies and say palms
kate or two male customers
pornography is a human universal
bomb
they're based in every society
i'm males
have done some sort of that kitchens
of naked females
for the purpose of a route soul
the midget trees
or
to sort of sculptures
i wanna but we're just findings
in the last
a or so
is it is extends as well
the monkey point
and so some scientists said to set up a situation
we're monkeys
hey
produced by giving a fruit juice
look at a picture
either the females hind quarters
or of a celebrity monkey
a socially dominant market
some sort of combination of people magazine and penthouse
and i
so there's some interest in this even by monument
products
what about actual preference for sexual variety
well
even get at this in different ways
tom
there is wet biology is describe
as on the coup which affects
of this year
the coolly defect is based on president calvin kuwait
and it's a story about calvin foolish
wife
who are being shown around the farm
separately
and a person showing ran his wife
the doubt
that there was a lot of hands
gigi noticed that there's a lot of hands but only one rooster
and she asked that by showing her around this one rooster not
the guy's well you know
the rooster works very hard rooster sex dozens upon today
and she said will be sure it's collected or pres
story goes
prison
one around
take the guy tells a story to the president
pres massa mapping
dozens of times each day
same hand every time
this is no different than
every time
he says
tell that to mrs coach
now
now there's two responses to this
sort of story
and a welcome in a web is what everybody knows
males prefer anonymous sex was strange when though
the other responses
that sexist
you might think you may be a male and say
he
you might know males in zeta males i know or not like that
so that you find out what was indirect measure such as who goes to prostitutes
there's also fairly direct measures one fairly direct measure
is on
if you'd asked people
in anonymous surveys
so in fact i give you some anonymous surveys i'm not pass people
a disaster
so you so
so for instance
i want everybody to consider this question
how many sexual partners she won happen the next month
what is it going up table
i'm a sexual partners you wanted
you
next two years
big many views are graduation
when you leave yelling like
i had accepts will partners and that's what i want
or
your lifetime
we get people panties question
ah professor charmed
last
here in this course
they got people than out to do it
we are not so high tech
soldiers do it in our heads
but here's the way dancers come out
women say less than one in next month that doesn't mean they want
than one that means
many of them
isn't that many of them say cyril
some say want so on
juan
fortified
men
to
a eighteenth
even as the other quest
from this population to us
when you have sex of a desirable partner you have mouse
really really desire
four year
women say aye
yes
six months and sure
we were less know
men
i
and
well then you can get a majority
going down on
soon too
five minutes
stomp
this is all que in a
pen and pencil sort of thanks
some great scientists have actually done it's
germans
tom
and in one experiment
somebody
i don't you know this is working with you cry when do nowadays
and then ten years ago
where they have an incredibly attractive man incredibly attractive one
and they approach people on campus
we're not from campus to repair actors brought in
and they go the people to strangers may say
by the noticing you around campus i find you very attractive
would you go ultimatum and
would you come over to my apartment tonight
would you go to bed with me tonight
it's fair that you wouldn't think anybody would about
than that
and women
there
about that very attractive man over half of the women are broke
say yes i will
very few agree to this
a nobody
in recess
for man
they are like this
they go up to their huh
in
in the study
twenty five percent of males
um said no
apologize refuse lisa that polio
fiance is in town to us
what about behavior
well
the people in us and sex differences
tom
you can't actually
figure out
what people want
male female differences
by looking at
simply at the average number of times people have sex
because
it male or female had different priorities
in heterosexual sex is a compromise
between two groups of people
petey interest
how
what's a mort
clear reflection and
gay sex
between the women between
two women are between two mac
because then you get up here reflection
of
mom
i'm sexual desire
that it did it and be very messy again or survey settings
but
why enlarged every study down
find a difference unexpected direction
which is that females tend to be
lesbians
tend to be
much more monotonous
then gay man
calm
some studies
prior to that
prior to aids
on this in many years ago
found a man to be
it really permit you saw happen over a hundred or four thousand
partners
you wouldn't find a sort of promise huey
in kenya
in females and a way to think about this as
what is gay men are doing is exactly
what your average heterosexual men would too
if the hat
that degree of willing females were as willing as he was
and that's all suggested or some sort of different along
winds expected
in the sexual issues units
in humans
what about
sexual of facts
what about may preference what are we find attractive
well
on like a choosing a studies here we actually at some pretty good crossed cultural day
so one saudi princes was gone
ten thousand people
from thirty seven countries
asking people
growing wanna
when one of a what
anders difference that a summit i'm asking
who'd you wanna marriage
other cities you want as a maid who he wants a sexual partner
then one main finding this
connor reassuring
by the way likes highness an intelligent
or does the recess the finest hours
these are valued pretty high
but at the same time there are sex differences
on females
focus more on how warned status
and mourning dress investing in children
think about that from an evolutionary point of view it makes sense
it doesn't matter hugely
from the standpoint of reproduction
how old the mats
the difference between fifteen and twenty five or thirty five forty five
may matter a lockers status nicky unity is physical strength is white
but the standpoint of this
firm doesn't matter huge
later on
there's a drop
and it does begin to that
but as a matter huge
mom
what does matter is is interestingly of good father
in protecting you
probation for murder
from assault by other people
and in taking care of the kid
women's brains are wired up
fine males with those properties
similarly
mammals
for whistle the differently
they're more impressive
in all of these things but also in the billie to have children
so from an evolutionary point of view
there's actually a very big difference between a twenty year old and a fifty iraq
from a male standpoint looking at a female
because the one can have lost
another cannot
so this is a difference
what a wanna focused more on right now
to another similarity
everybody likes beauty
and i wanted devote a low that this lecture
talking
about physical beauty
physical be a
as he's beautiful people say
is a curse
association is at my got a big models
the new super super blot
mom
ghali said arbitrary nuts
finding her devastated we beautiful
famous actor
clinton afresh they areas
that people only
ignore his accomplishments and focus merely
on this physical beauty
russia for us
found
so
so what is the late what is this mean
when we say we find
it out
yeah
they really are very attractive people
what is it about that
it makes you look and say
yeah that makes sense
well
the kinder know the answer we know some universal us
you need seems a signal to thank
yeah anything to signaled you've
i mean not pre school you
but but but the years like
sexually at
truly mitch for
but
young
pomp
so the accuse me fighting for accused of that
large eyes
for lips
smooth bright skin
in the signal something else
beauty is a marker for help
and so will we find beautiful
these are the absence of the form of these
clear eyes
on blunder skin
tacky
very good
in an average face
that last part might seem oldest
rain
what would be so good about nap or tricks
there's demands for said that the one hand serious
i'm
an average face on
average
should be considered
cracked it
because any sort of before monday's
our variations from that
and if you average in every case together
you get a face that's that
when nothing bad has happened
there's no distortion
there's no tv asia
as one gets order face gets lesser magical
and so on
average ness seems the fact rubble of bad things that happen
good theory
how we know it's
well
who's a photo roster
that combat i have access to for this class
so i could look at each of your pictures
man
i will make you a better but listen most beautiful
face
in this course
tom
the bed as it would be
all of you
ah huh
when the funded by showed us some of these men
can i
the aha
a
faggot and an essay
i don't have the energy to do this and be
right violate four hundred different
privacy laws or whatever
but if i talk all a spaces
and more of them together
i would get a very
thirty
thanks
and i'm out of the notes
while people dance
they've been at work
so the faces from
here
here
and if you are like most people
you see as you're going to write
they're looking better and better of that
the saw
but essentially not so subtle
that babies don't notice it
the same researchers ribbons record this
his face these
i would hop nation faces
male be now
have shown these faces the babies
planted babies prefer to look at average faces
suggests mare better preference for average
is not a product of culture
or rather some extent hard why
the issue people don't exist
did you get accomplices
on
there
a heavily average
male pace
in a heavily average
he nope it's both
from a caucasian data set
they don't look back right
did that faces a
they don't she's a big year for instance is
is identical saddam
can use here
for a tractor
but the story of a trap and this is not end there
how'd you get a better an average face
what can you do these faces these average faces
and make them work
even better
well pablo
who's prettier
who says the women are right
who says the one left
left is average face
under might be variation in this plastered near death was variations what people paper
this is a famine eyes version
of the average face
we're certain productive features were made more feminine
shoo
this
as more was sexual
object
this is more complicated
and i
cool
who thinks the face
with a space a. a. is more crack
if
with a space india's more tractor
most people
right
face be
the exception is
and this is vince insisted we wrap when it i think now and three lapse
calm
they say is preferred by women were occupied
and
and the story about why
is on
it is
complicated
beyond the scope of this plaque
currently the idea that
this is a really handsome guy
to young he's healthy
he looks strong good provider
this guy's really hot
and then
he may not be a good provider and everything but i'm curious
wonderful g.
so the idea is that one to that
him
then have him raise tickets
if i
talks so far about things of that
uh that sacks
and sexual attracted ms
largely promote while logical
you'll be a universal senate but there are some universe souls
in what men and women have in common
and what
being with men and women
and i
and some of the sex differences particularly to aggression
ah
and a preference
seemed to be universal they seem to show up to some extent
cross every culture you look at
an answer likely candidates for biological adaptation
right
there are other sex differences that people are aware of
with origins are far less
and i think that intelligent reasonable people can disagree about this
but i am personally quite
call it picks
bend
to which these reflect biology
on a bomb mention them
to capture that the debate
within the human mind there is that
is that
biology
natural selection is one reason why the menendez classmates differ
from the women's
but of course are other social factors
babies are treated differently
given many studies were you take a baby
and you swallow it and blow
and describe it as a boy
versus one when he can describe it as a broke
people treated differently
when they think it's a boy
the money think it's a girl
ah
here treated differently too
it matters a lot under study after study suggesting princes
but when you send in email
or job application
or a paper to a scientific journal
it matter
whether it has the name john smith on
versus the name
joan smith
it matters
because people had different expectations indifferent react
the males versus females
some of you
may have a
first hand experience with this
if you're a man with a name that can be taken
as a woman's name
ah my friend a minus mainland
and often people think
he's female
or if you're a woman was a name that be taken as a man's name
or the other names officially foreign
the western here said that people can easily cow
we often find it wasn't
oh
you were high five each other they're found
pull
you'll often find some degree of surprise
and some believe using all my i didn't know you were a map
now i would think differently
bomb
and so these social factors
play a role
in explaining some a own female differences
also there's a facts of gender self segregation
so here something very interesting happens development for
males
said brigade will father males
female segregated will brother females
for a period
lasting it depends on the culture
but say from a age
forty age eleven
this self segregation might exaggerated
and enhanced
sex differences
it might be differences as eleanor back to be as proposed
that that boys are slightly more aggressive than girls
with them boys
go into groups of boys
and that enhance isn't exaggerated air gretchen
while the gross non aggressive behavior
isn't hanson exaggerated different ways
by them falling two girls groups
so what sort of differences are we talking about
when we say we're not sure of their pot
one difference
is one and empathy
so
simon barren calling
wrote a wonderful book called the essential difference
story ideas
that
men are by nature
less sympathetic women are by nature more and pathetic
mom
and ended this is a four
so
well you know well but what was a source for this
when these men are more violence
simon down colin describes on violence is the ultimate act
murder as the ultimate
the black and the state
on the summer wages ship between hammers testosterone
you have in your system
and how socially war
more testosterone less social
boys
and to be less sympathetic than girls
and there's some evidence though it's not conclusive
boys do worse than girls
our nation the remind tasks
that's where have here
though that is quite debated
and the biggest effect which isn't debated at all
is
problems with empathy
problems of social cod mission
bomb
are much more frequent
in men than women
so
disorders like watches and ask further syndrome
con that disorder and sigh copy
our pre donnelly mail
and simon down call when suggest
that
palm basically as a slogan
where it says
to be a matter
is a suffer from a publicly mild formal boxes
the nails or to socially clueless
relative
to women
final bit of trivia
this is simon down column
who is a very famous development of psychologist
but his cousin sasha barren cohen
is far more famous
tom
another did they
is that debate concerning sex differences
passing for math and science
a few years ago
we used to be a president of harbor
known as larry summers
there's so many reasons the case at this point
around
but
and larry summers is no longer present of harvard
various reasons
but one reason was this call
which included
in this speculations about sex differences
find some engineering
their issues of inch
forensic acted too
and vertically of the very ability that perky
he argue
our suggestive
the donna representation of women in the sciences and i think the mia
is because
ah
up and intrigues a gap in two different
women are on average
west by logically
scott free disclose
to do this sort of reasons
the very ability point is that
he wasn't suggesting that if two just a difference on average
effectively that the average
kills men and women are identical
claim is
that male show more variation
this means of there's more male retarded people
and more males with this horribly practice
but it also means or more mail
geniuses
in the suggestive
that this plays a role
this as you could imagine proved to be geeks
namely controversial
climb
and tom rather than ghost
relate to that would take me up
last
pros and cons of his argument
possibly
i'm gonna work
for you
to a wonderful the bay
between sleeping there who was quarter earlier
and this felt a
who's won a big
got caught mission people read
we spoke a lot about her work earlier on
unable wonderful debate
smart as people i know
ah
on the edge
get out which withstand a harbor
of a year ago
and is on video
here
so here in dress in sex differences
and different views about the mechanism of sex offenses
hi this is where
you should go
finally
and a final topic
some of us about ninety eight percent
and the numbers are very difficult and down
maybe there's a ninety percent maybe it's ninety seven
maybe it's nineteen
the say ninety percent
tom
of women
are sexually attracted
to man
a boat ninety six percent of men
are sexually attracted to women
and the numbers vary and is very difficult estimate a properly as you can imagine closer to
with a sort of research
what are some proportion of population
that's exclusively homosexual
some proportion of population of man
only attracted to other men
some proportion population the women
we're only attractive
the other women
when people talk about sexual orientation there
it's important to realize
we're not talking here
about behavior
ah there's all sorts of reason
why somebody might have sex
with somebody of the same sex
you know
there might be more
you made you know
they are meant to be whatever
the question is what he wanted
all cynthia what what
what sort of course the few good piece actually a romantically involved
with any person
who wouldn't they
and most people are heterosexual
there's a considerable amount of barry's crossed hopefully
people who are bi sexual
but the real cause a liz
who's up on the sexuality
so why
well
nobody knows
we know some reasons
some answers are probably not right
bomb
it is not the case
almost certainly
maybe there's some exceptions but is not the case
he will choose or sexual orientation
ah
i'm not gonna do this in this room
if i ask people to razor has that
how many people
decided
who'd become sexually attracted to
very few people would
ah
part of a shoe rises in fact that
people who are gay are often it's
i mean we discriminate again
annette no wish to be gave him a vegas morally
all
for them to be that way
that makes it impossible
their sexual orientation is a contest
royce
what about that
experience after puberty
so there's there's a new attitude coming up or vern already gentle literature
people were gay
of some sense buns
seduced
by people by other people
our something happen afterwards
bomb
this seems unlikely
i there are
ah
in particular the seeds of of sexually occasion later on in law
seemed to show up
quite early in life
again the studies are sort of suspected or some reason to believe
bull
who are gay and people who are straight are different
long before they hit puberty
with regard to her sexual and romantic
fantasies
he would now expect me to say
well
being gay in being straight is built dentist
our wire
none of these stories seemed right
this is rebuild them
imagine that is
sort of
so if you do this standard behavioral genetics acts
and a new by now know how to do them
you look for different city mama's i got in dies i got a twins
you did adoption
stop
comparison you adopted siblings a biological siblings
answer is
yes
you'll find
that
there is some sort of
genetically disposition
ford's homosexuality
i got
can't be entirely
jeanette
one reason why we can't they can't be entirely genetic ms
if i am gay
and i haven't identical to
the also my identical twin
will be gay
it's about fifty percent
those are very high ox compared to the average in the population
but
it was truly jeanette
hi early genetic
what should the number b. a
hundred percent is my clone
he should be exactly as i am
and it's not
so we know then that some sort of experience
possibly prenatal experience
is what explains
why is it so
said before does a huge piles up
why is there such a huge
well
if schools of homosexuality is an evolutionary mr
again
do not think it is carries a moral weight to it
ah
what it does mean though is that it doesn't seem to follow as a biological adaptation
hello is not
why is it that some men have sex with men
as honored because i'm a at sex with men
a subs are recreational thing are pair bonding or whatever
that's not the polls
puzzle is
why heather cement
don't want to have sex
look women
similarly
why are the summit women who don't wanna have sex
with men
from an evolutionary adapted standpoint
you would think that the genes that give rise to sector behavior
tom
would be weed it out
because creatures with that behavior typically
putting aside modern technology don't have off
and that's what makes it such
counsel
so you're reading response for this week it is
it's all that parcel
and i said early on in the course to reading responses be really easy
and is required recited back things
but that proved to be too boring
so
so does solve this deepest the wall puzzles
then rapids at the end is very important
on your account
whatever it is
should bear some relationship to the fact
as discussed in lectures in weeks
tom
we have about five more minutes
any questions of ops
yes
thank you very much
stop
she likes my leather jacket
a
any questions or thoughts
that one
now yes
as a dupont on hold on
mom
that's a very good question because certainly around certain origin
give me two more minutes
certainly after that the origin of sexual preference in humans
will be informed
what we do not wizard of many animals engage in
b. a.
engage in sex
members of their own sex
what i don't know
is whether you get eggs
crusoe
i'm a sexual behavior
so i don't know what the radius
the non human pry mates for instance
prime rate not one have sex
with members of options
okay
see you
all wednesday
