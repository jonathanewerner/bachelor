sex is really strange
you asked people
favorite activity
and if you ask people particularly
college students
typically at this
spring break
i've seen the movies
comp
though all the matter
sex or some
word at this anonymous sex
but
there's a come up puzzle
about how much time we spend on sex
times others data on
so people say sexes are favorite activity
but it turns out we actually no
how much time average american spends
on sex
and
did they animal follow from a some rise by this witness wonderful book by james polite
tom
have
americans tell pulitzer single favorite activity is sex
in terms of enjoy ability
they rang sex ahead of us
sports
fishing bar hopping
hugging kissing
talking with the family
eating
watching television going on trips
planning trips gardening
bathing shopping dressing house workers watching laundry
visiting advances in gettin' the car repair
on the other hand
this same studies suggested average time her day devoted to sex
is
for minutes and three sex

as like says
dz not much
even at the for minutes is inc school dz
time
fend flirting
dancing
i'm going
cruising double of our
toni up in jams tony up and beauty bars
rehearsing pick up winds
shower inc
king about sex reading about sex
brutally pornographic late
i
looking at erotic mag
genes
renting videos dreaming of sex
looking at fashion magazines cleaning up after sex
coping with the consequences of sex
building towers
or otherwise were pressing transferring
and so will mating
and
i like this passage
because it illustrates two points
one point
one is we don't actually is
spend that much time on sex
in factor for minutes and three seconds an interesting number
because
would you and when you do time studies
how much americans
than
filling out
we're late informs
for retire asked
it's four minutes in a few sack
wrong
but
the passage also point so that regardless of the brute time we spend on it
this its
fort narrowly important
on everything
unlike follows from
marriage
family
children
much of aggression
much of competition
much of art and music and creative pursuits
much of everything false from at
if we were creature without sex
everything would be different
and
was interesting as
dark creatures without sex
there are creatures it reproduce by cloning
and in fact
this basic fact about people
that we fall roughly in the males and females
is a evolutionary best
it's not clear why animals that are somewhat large
from what i've why logical darwin the in perspective
adding two sexes is bizarre
is each time you haven't offspring you toss away happy genes
my children only at each them have half
maybe in may
if i was to clone
they would have all of it
and so to puzzle have sex ever paul
this is not a course in evolutionary biology and that's not the puzzle will be looking at today
well that
few correct
first let's talk
from forces theoretical pointed you
and then empirical poignant you
about how
males and females are different
then let's talk about sexual attractive mess
some research of a what people find
to be sexually attractive
and all top of that little that and
a but origins of sexual preference why some people worst
great
others gay
others bisexual
others harder to classified
on
now
of all the topics on presenting sexes one of the sort of
stacy want
from an emotional point of view
these are difficult issue
because sex is
by definition an intimate part of our lives
and then it matters a lot
moral work sexes fraught will moral implication
and says i'm talking about this from
at least the beginning
from a dar with a an evolutionary perspective
on
a mobile like to start up by dealing with some of the moral consequences and moral implications
so for instance
many a biology us
all biology us i would say will of argued
that on
that
sexual behavior sexual action sexual desire
this is some extent a biological adaptation existing to spread are genes
from that perspective and
non crow creative sex
including on
gay sex
sex with birth control
sex bright most men also women
i'm does not
sure this reproductive goal
and in some sense wraps
is unnatural
and one might are you then
does this mean it's wrong
will also be talking but sex
differences between men and women for instance
yeah non
in how much you want anonymous
sexual encounters
differences between men and women
in social intelligence
in aggression empathy
and
regardless of what you think about
these
differences
would you think they're right or wrong are doesn't matter
you asked a question to what extent are amiable
that is
they exist
to darwin you natural selection
to what extent calm
can we ever get rid of
i wanna address those two issues issues of morality
in inevitable witty
on
from the very start
and i wanna start off with
bomb
look for each of them have a quarrel
by a prominent evolutionary dz
stalin so the first one
by steve thinker
and how the mind works
in their rights
nature does not dictate what we should accept the how which live our lives
well into micro pro kuwaiti years i and so far voluntarily trial us
having swan rd my biological resources reading and writing doing research
helping of france's students and jogging in circles
ignoring the solemn dared to spread my genes
why don't we in standards i am horrible mistake a pathetic loser
but i'm happy that way of my genes don't like it they can go jump in the lake
he this point i think is a reasonable one
ah
it is true
that certain things we do
exist to serve the dictates of natural selection
but that doesn't make them right
how did you think that something is only right
if it leads to the generation of more
genes
if it leads to reproduction
can you not that i think very much about birth control

you not a thing very much about any sort of non crow created sex
another and if you're
moreover if you think something's wrong
if it's to it it's unnatural
you not that i think much about
flying a plane
or refer to raiding food
or surviving severe infection
more generally our bodies and brains have evolved reproductive success
that we can use these brains choose around destiny is
nothing moral necessarily follow from factor biology
that's on essay about more out
but i want you to keep in mind when we discussed
different claims were what's of all what
hasn't
what ability never the billie
i'm here i wanna turned to richard dawkins
richard dawkins rights
average violence had bad
teaching in mathematics the disease
the resulting deficiency can be remedy
by actually good teaching and following year
would any suggestion of a trials efficiency may have a genetic origin
is likely to be greeted with something approaching this
there
did genes is it
conduct
and nothing can be done about it
this is pernicious nonsense on an almost astrological scale
genetic causes environmental causes are principle no different
from each other
some may be hard to reverse others may be easy
why did genes wedded genes do to deserve their sinister juggernaut like reputation
why are genes thought to be so much more fixed and inescapable winner effect
television nuns or books
i like the nuns pomp
and
only areas
what causes something
is logically separate
from what can reverse it
an
you think of clear cases
we're something is plainly jeanette
what is fairly easily reversed
or something is cultural
in is very difficult to reverse
here's an example
my ive side is quite for
the reason why my eyes face blake for
is not to
to to pay g artie
television culture are the man
rather
my i said is quite war
you look happy genes
mom and dad david genetically determined of anything as
it is also
clearly easy effects
thirties mush
genes
how
would you put genes of last
cried your eyes
and helping to see that
more advanced machines known as contact lenses actually stick dipping into your eyes
and at the cost of occasional infections
you are to
you become to see that
it is why logically
cost
but fairly easy defects
on the other hands take an example of
science treatment of those weeks
it turns out when we and we will get us a little that without what sexual attractive yes
health in somebody years
or how bad they are
what you think of that is actually
not typically hard why the varies a lot from culture to culture
but once is enough culture it is almost impossible to dz
so the point there is just that
genetic does not mean inevitable
and
cultural does not mean easy defects
okay
best general backed up
let's start with basic sex that
was it differently males and females
well
don't even think
penis under john
out there's a lot of animals that had neither one
and it it was actually runs deeper
by definition
when well the just talk about this
calm
animals that are males
have a little sex cell
carries genes and nothing else
sperm cells
animals that are females have a big sex cell
on which as genes
but also food and a protective cover and all sorts of others
typically
the little sex cell isn't much murmured in a big sex cell
this is the only erotic picture and show you today
they the ones you'll sperm
going around
hey
it's romantic
follow
would this raises a paul hall
i just described male and female
roughly in terms of the size different
males are smaller
i'd sex cells
females are they there
why is it then
so many animals
males
art a bigger wants
physically
and more aggressive wants
this is that a puzzle as occupied scientists
for a long long time
and
would true that there is now
a pretty clear answer to it
and then to those like this
is this an idea
by robert trivers
call parental investment
and what parental investment is
find years as
any investment
that's been increased
dobbs
green's chance of survival
cost of the parents
ability to invest
in other ops
so for example
suppose in animal between offspring
by blinking an eye
and in often the run off
that a week stream with little invest
suppose another animal had to work for ten years
and during those ten years
could not create another off
that'd be a huge investment
trivers point cell
that with him as species
females
typically have a much higher parental investment
then males
tom
because females have
typically the bacon internally
carries
if there egg tonight at to sit on
and
hence each potential child
is a huge go
for males
which have the small sex cell
you don't have the same sack
for males
on
it might just be
few moments of of copulation
and that's that
beauty that after cell
humans
each one of you under rome
what is than the animal
you can do
to create a trial
as happy genes
and as a pattern
that the male investment on average is lower
then the female smith males can choose
or might you better often some circumstances
putting a lot of investment in are off
run
but females don't have a choice
females barring technological advance
have a huge investment into any off great
i'm not investment in the sense of hard work an effort
to
i'm investment in the sense that when year when you
the jest when we're having
when you're pregnant www one offspring you can't have
another
what this does
is it has ramifications of perky laid out for
so
italy to different psychologies
males
a single male can fertilize several females
forcing some males to go mateless
in giving rise
competition
to see who could mate with the most females
for females
however females can always find mates
so sheer numbers dont caps
a lot
this competition to mate with the right
males
those is offering have the best chance
of surviving
wrong
the competition
now explains the puzzle we started explains why males
we larger
and often one males of a vaults
to weapons
he special weapons of all
fighting other males
for reproductive access
it also explain something else
females
why logically are choosy
and so males happened big not merely of other males
to on
to to to get reproductive access
but also to woo females
and so often males evolved special displays
like
yes
which exist
only
to be beautiful
only to be attractive
and to attract
mates
tom
cole evolutionary logic was captured
in this courtroom
if
so
really those some mob a hundred years
of mate selection research
the logic
goes like this then
differences size in sex cells
lisa differences in typical parental best man
leading the differences in the sorts of psychological physiological mechanisms of all
okay that's a good story
what sort of evidence is therefore
well it turns out this could explains a mother why surprising thanks
for instance
there should be do or some cases
where parental investment is switch
some cases where turns a word a males
and out with more investment
then the females
and it then
the theory projects
tom
that in these cases you should get an a symmetry
so in cases like pipefish for instance
the male takes the eggs
in to apparel
and plugs them into his blood string
the females should rot
they have less of investment in the males
in this case
you would protect
as a stroke
females
should be larger
females fight
other females more than males right males
females
try to compete for the tension of the males
call
the movie march of the penguins
we saw a clip from at
and this was in the context of discussing no motions
that of of all
ford's are off
but remember the story
and how both male and female happy blue tremendous minds
to protect eck
and of one of them fails gay dives in the the one has a
you should then not even have to remember
whether male females are much bigger
than female penguins
you should realize
should not be in in fact they are
there but the same size
because it the parental investment
is equal
you should be able to project a science differences and aggression differences
based on differing parental investment
so for a sense
tom elephant seals
for tiny males are enormous
score times bigger than the females
this isn't large part
because elephant seals compete for carol mz of females
is a winner take all
gibbons are about the same size
and is a because gibbons are pretty monotonous to raise children
together
this illustrate something
which is is not always the case
ah
that male parental investment
is law
there are some species including gibbons
where
is in the males reproductive advantage to care for top
imagine a situation for instance work
and off
bring would die
will parents didn't want to for many years
and
where
devoted offering have to be exclusive
if you focus on another family or when away
the offering would die
in that case you had people
investment
it would matter equally to the male and female
to invest no offspring and the cost
would be the same
there's no species
hard as the species that at that
much of an people system
but some cry mates are close to it
in this raises the question then
what about humans
what about us
what are we know about the differences between
males and females
well
humans
are relatively polygamous species
most cultures
most human cultures
are on
polygamous
american culture
is what they call cereal monopoly
so we're not like some species of birds we don't mate for life
we do is years appear bombings
for some period of time could be for life
would he need not be in usually isn't
males are bigger and females
human males to size estimates vary so much
the average human males but fifteen percent
larger in average human female
this is yes that are some a there's been
in our evolutionary history
some male male competition
bomb
for access to females
which suggests than turner
the parental investment is not quite equal
on males have smaller testicles
for their body size
than chin cans easy
but larger testicles
the new rosen gibbons
on
and this suggested there was
some intermediate amount of competition
for the past me
creates
this is relevant for different sort of competition
which regards in craig nation of
females have multiple mates
in this suggested over evolutionary history
women were not wanton lee
promiscuous but we're not higher than the not
so much so that that it a from evolutionary point of view
you do will fall males to all the capacity to produce me what's
sperm
other males
aggression males are meaner
the and some arising year meters not a technical term
females can be meaner but males
are this more
physically violence
there more violent
in the womb in utero
your more violent as age
over and
under more violent as adults
tom again
this is not to say that you can find violent women
or non violent and
age is on average
there is is difference
tom
more
males kick more
in the utero this
i'm as children to mourn balkan play fighting in violent
combat like sports
and as adults
wherever you go you will find a prison
and wherever you go you will find that prison is mostly philip
full of men
and therefore more likely
one another
and a harmon other
and
male sex hormones
throat
are the sort not the sort of thing one would one reject and somebody
unless you want them to turn
kind in the
they increase aggressive nest
both inc humans
and another product
what about sexual choosiness
to male humans and female humans differ
a and the extent to which
they will
favorite anonymous sex
and
this is relevant from an evolutionary perspective
because the parental investment theory predicts males
should be more receptive to anonymous sex
because
on
for males
to trade innate somebody else
might
for choice leave lead to another off
it might be good for you
and doesn't carry
the sort of harm
that females another unhappy very hickey
because they have to choose
careful
remember these systems of all for birth
for all
and the second knees and cell
so what we know crossed culture wait
and psychological well
prostitution
is the universally
me or near universally
male
ah been dressed
there are male prostitutes of course
but contrary to some
various fantasies in sitcom dz
kate are to male customers
pornography is a human universal
on
embrace in every society
on males
have done some sort of the kitchens
of naked females
for purpose of a route soul
them into trees
or
to sort of sculptures
i wanna but we're this findings
in a last
a are so
is it is extent as well
the monkey porn
and so some scientists that to set up a situation
we're monkeys
hey
produced by giving approved years
look at a picture
deserve a females hind quarters
or of a celebrity monkey
a socially dominant
some sort of combination of people magazine and penthouse
and i
so are some interest in this even by monument
products
what about actual preference for sexual variety
well
even get at this in different ways
tom
there is wet biology is describe
and some the coolidge effect
of this year
the coolidge effect is based on president how and coolidge
and it's a story about calvin coolidge
wife
who are being shown around the farm
separately
and a person showing around his wife
did out
that there was a lot of hands
gigi noticed that there's a lot of hands but only one rooster
and she asked that by showing around is one rooster not
the guy's well you know
the rooster worked very hard richard sex dozens upon today
and she said will be sure thought that are pres
story goes
prison
when around
data by tells a story to the president
pres massa mapping
dozens of times each day
same hand every time
that's is no different than
every time
he says
tell at the misses coolidge
now
now there's true responses to this
sort of story
and a welcome innate what is what everybody knows
males prefer anonymous sex was strange when go up
the other responses
that's sexes
you might think you may be a male and say
he
you might know males and say to males i know or not like that
so that you find out what was indirect measures such as who los a prostitutes
there's also fairly direct measures one fairly direct nature
is on
if you'd asked people
in anonymous surveys
so in fact i give you some anonymous survey some not passed people
a disaster
so you so
so for instance
i want everybody babysitter discord
how many sexual partners you wanna happen the next month
what is it going of april
how many sexual partners you wanna mate
he
next two years
big many views your graduation
would you leave yelling like
i had sex sexual partners and that's what i want
or
your lifetime
we get people fantasies question
ah professor charmed
last
year discourse
they got people than out to do it
we are not so high tech
soldiers do it in our heads
but here's the way the answers come out
women's a less than one in next month that doesn't mean they want
than one that means
many of them
isn't that many of them say cyril
some say wants on
one
fortified
men
to
a eighteenth
in the mask other quest
from this population to us
would you have sex with a desirable partner you have mouse
the really desire
for year
women say i
yes
six months unsure
week or less no
men
i
and
who then you begin a majority
going down on
to to
five minutes
stomp
this is all few in a
pen and pencil sort of thanks
some grades scientists have actually done it's
germans
tom
and in one experiment
somebody
i don't you know this is working with you by one do nowadays
in than ten years ago
we're a have an incredibly attractive man incredibly attractive one
and a approach people on campus
we're not from campus to repair factors brought in
and they go the people to strangers in the say
i been noticing you around campus i find you very attractive
would you go out me tonight
would you come over to my apartment tonight
would you go to bed with me tonight
it's fair that you wouldn't think anybody would about
than that
and women
there
about very attractive man all the half of the women are broke
say yes i will
very few agree to this
and nobody
increases
for man
they are like this
the doctor there huh
in
in the study
twenty five percent of males
um said no
apologize to few salinas it all yo
fiance is in town to us
what about behavior
well
people in us and sex differences
tom
you can't actually
figure out
what people want
male female differences
by looking at
simply at the average number of times people have sex
because
it male or females had different priorities
been heterosexual sexes a compromise
between two groups of people
petey interest
how
what i'm worked
clear reflection and
gay sex
between women between
two women are between two mac
because then you get appear reflection
of
mom
of sexual desire
then the david attended the very messy again or survey studies
but
why am large every study dont
find a difference unexpected direction
which is that females tend to be
lesbians
and to be
much more monotonous
then gay man
calm
some studies
prior to that
prior to aids
on this in many years ago
found gay men to be
it really permit years often have over a hundred over thousand
partners
you wouldn't find disorder promised you a
in female
in females and awaited think about this as
what is gay men are doing is exactly
what you average heterosexual men would you
if he had
that degree of willing females were as willing as he was
and this all suggested or some sort of different along
minds expected
a and sexual choosiness
in humans
what about
sexual of facts
what about mate preference what are we find attractive
well
on likely choosiness studies here we at yes i'm pretty across cultural data
so one saudi princes was gone
ten thousand people
from thirty seven countries
asking people
growing wanna
who in one of a what
anders different studies summit i'm asking
would you wanna marriage
other cities you want as a maid who you want to sexual partner
then one main finding this
connor reassuring
by the way likes kindness and intelligence
or does the recess they like kindness and
is are valued pretty high
with the same time there are sex differences
on females
focus more on power and status
and mourning dress investing in children
think about that from an evolutionary point of you it makes sense
it doesn't matter hugely
from the standpoint of reproduction
how old the mats
the difference between fifteen and twenty five or thirty five forty five
may matter a lot for status nicky beauty is physical strength is white and
but for standpoint of this
firm doesn't matter huge
later on
there's a drop
it does begin to that
but as a matter future
on
what does matter is is interestingly of good father
in protecting you
prediction from murder
from assault way other people
and in taking care the kid
women's brains are wired out
find males with those properties
similarly
mammals
full this'll the differently
they're more interested
in all of these things but also in the billie to have children
so from evolutionary point of view
there's actually a very big difference between a twenty year old and a fifty or
from a male standpoint looking at a female
because the one can have lost
another cannot
so this is a difference
what a wanna focus more on right now
to another similarity
everybody likes beauty
and i wanted to vote follow the this lecture
talking
about physical beauty
physical be a
as he's beautiful people say
is a curse
association is at my got a big models
the new super super blot
on
boy so the arbitrary nuts
finding are devastated we beautiful
famous actor
police enough for status
the people only
ignore his accomplishments in focus merely
on this physical beauty
this fend for us
found
so
so what is beauty what is this mean
when we say we find
it out
yeah
they really are very attractive people
what is it about that
innate you look and say
yeah that makes sense
well
the condom no the answer we know some universals
beauty seems a signal to thank
yeah anything to signaled youth
a week not pre school youth
but but but but years like
sexually at
truly mitch for
but
young
i'm
to accuse me find beautiful accused to that
large eyes
full lips
smooth tight skin
beauty signal something else
beauty is a marker for help
and so will we find beautiful
the leg absence of deformities
clear eyes
unblemished skin
intact teeth
predict
in an average face
that last part might seem oldest
rain
what would be so good about him average face
there's do when answers to that one answers
i'm
and average face on
average
should be considered
attractive
because any sort of deformities
a variations from that
and if you average in every case together
you get a face that's that
when nothing bad has happened
there's no distortion
there's no tv age
as one gets order face gets less are magical
and so on
average ness seems to factor or that means that the hap
good theory
halloween no it's
well
whose of follow roster
that combat ive access to for this class
so i can look at each of your pictures
and
i will make you a better but listen most beautiful
face
in this course
tom
the bed as a would be
all of you
our huh
when the one if i show summary name
can i
and i

faggot and and essay
i don't of the energy to do this and be
right violate four hundred different
privacy laws or whatever
but if i talk all a spaces
and more them together
i would get a very
thirty
face
and down have we noticed
well people don't us
they've done that with
so the faces from
here
here
and if you are like most people
you see as you're going to right
the looking better and better of that
the cell
but essentially not so subtle
that babies don't notice it
the same researchers with instructed this
the is face these
average caucasian faces
male be now
have shown a spaces to babies
find it babies preferred a look at average face it
suggests in our better preference for average
is not a product of culture
or rather some extent hard why
the issue people don't exist
did you get accomplices
on
there
a heavily average
male face
in are heavily average
female face both
from a occasion gay this half
they don't look back right
did that faces a
they don't she's a big year for instance is
is identical saddam
can use here
very attractive
but the story of attractive nurses not and there
how'd you get a better in average face
what can you do these faces these average face is
and make them work
even better
well pablo
whose prettier
who says the women are right
who says the one left
weapons average face
under my be variation in this plastered their w variations what people paper
this is a famine eyes version
up average face
we're certain productive features were made more feminine
q.
this
as more was sexual
object
this is a more complicated
and i
cool
who thinks the face
with a space a is more crack
if
who they say is the is more factor
most people
right
face be
the exception is
and this is been suggested we wrap with it i think known three lapse
on
face a is preferred women were occupied
and
and a story about why
is some
it is
complicated
beyond the scope of this plaque
currently the idea that
is a really handsome guy
to young is healthy
the look strong good provider
this guy's really hot
and then
he may not be a good provider and everything but i'm curious
wonderful g
so the idea is that one to that
im
then have him raise tickets
if i
talk so far about things of that
about sex
and sexual attractive ms
largely from of why logical
looking a universals and in fact there are some universals
in what men and women have in common
and what
being with men and women
and i
and some of the sex differences particularly to aggression
top
and mate preference
seemed to be universal they seem to show up to some extent
cross every culture you look at
an answer likely candidates for biological adaptation
but
your other sex differences that people are aware of
would origins are far less
and i think that intelligent reasonable people could disagree about this
but i am personally quite
call it fixed
fend
to which these reflect biology
on a bomb mention them
to capture that the debate
within even mind there is that
is that
biology
natural selection is one reason why the menendez classmates differ
from the women's
but of course are other social factors
babies are treated differently
given many studies were you take a baby
you swallow it and blue
and describe it as a boy
versus why wouldn't he can describe it as a grow
people treated differently
when they think it's of white
the money think it's a grow
on
here treated differently to
it matters a lot under study after study suggesting princes
but when you send in female
or job application
or a paper to a scientific journal
it matter
whether it has a name john smith on
versus the name
joan smith
it matters
because people had different expectations and different react
the males versus females
some of you
may have a
firsthand experience with this
if you're a matter what the name to be taken
as a woman's name
ah my friend a minus mainland
and often people think
he's female
or if you're a woman listening to be taken as a man's name
or the other names officially foreign
to western here said that people can easily top
the often find it wasn't
oh
you were high five each other they're found
will
you'll often find some degree of surprise
and some reveals a all my i didn't know you were a math
now i would treat differently
bomb
and so these social factors
play a role
in explains a male and female differences
also there's a facts of gender self segregation
so year something very interesting happens development for
males
segregation woo father males
female segregated will other females
for period
lasting it depends in the culture
but say from a age
forty age eleven
this self segregation mate exaggerated
and enhanced
sex differences
it might be differences as eleanor back to be as proposed
that that boys are slightly more aggressive than girls
with them boys
go into groups of boys
and that enhance is an exaggerated their aggression
while the gross non aggressive behavior
is in hanson exaggerated different ways
by them falling two girls books
so what sort of differences are we talking about
when we say we're not sure other cost
one difference
is one in empathy
so
simon barren call when
wrote a wonderful book called essential difference
story ideas
that
men are by nature
less sympathetic women are by nature more and pathetic
tom
and and that this is a for
so
will you not well but what was a source for this
when the is man a more violence
simon down colin describes violence is ultimate act
murder as the ultimate
the black empathy
on the summer lay should ship between how much testosterone
you have under system
and how social you are
more testosterone less social
boys
fend to be less sympathetic than girls
and there's some evidence those not conclusive
boys do worse than girls
our nation theory of mind tasks
that's where have here
dont that is quite debated
and the biggest effect which isn't debated at all
is
problems with empathy
problems of social cod mission
bomb
are much more frequent
in men than women
so
disorders like autism password or syndrome
conduct disorder and psychopathy
our pre donnelly male
and simon down colin suggest
that
palm basically as a slogan
where it says
to be a matter
is a suffer from a publicly mild form of autism
that males are to socially clueless
relative
to women
final but ive trivia
this is simon down column
who is a very famous development of psychologists
with his cousin sasha barren going
is far more famous
tom
another did they
is that debate concerning sex differences
passing for math and science
a few years ago
we used to be a president of harbor
known as larry summers
this only reason fetus at this point
around
but
and larry summers is no longer present of harvard
various reasons
but one reason was this call
which included
in this speculations of of sex differences
science in engineering
their issues of
nuns it acted to
and typically of the very ability that he
he argue
our suggestive
the dont a representation of women in the sciences inactive the mia
is because
ah
up and intrigues a gap a to different
women are on average
west by logically
out free dispose
to do this sort of reasons
the very ability point is that
he wasn't suggesting that if to just a difference on average
effect the greeted average
kills men and women are identical
claim is
bed males show more variation
this means of years more male retarded people
and more males with this horribly practice
but also means are more male
geniuses
any suggestive
that displays a role
this as you could imagine proved to be mates
keenly controversial
climb
and rather than ghost
related would take me up
last
pros and cons of his argument
possibly
and a rough
for you
to a wonderful the bay
between sleeping care who was quarter earlier
and this felt the
whose wanted big
got caught mission people we
we spoke a lot of other worked earlier on
in their home wonderful debate
smart is people i know
ah
on the edge
yet at which which than a harvard
of a year ago
in is on video
here
so theory dress in sex differences
and different views about the mechanism of sex differences
i this is where
you should go
finally
and a final top
some of us about ninety eight percent
and the numbers are very difficult and down
maybe this a ninety percent maybe it's ninety seven
maybe it's nineteen
the say ninety percent
tom
of women
are sexually attractive
to man
a boat ninety six percent the man
are sexually attracted to women
under numbers very and it's very difficult estimate are properly as you can imagine closer to
with disorder research
with or summer portion of population
that's exclusively homosexual
some proportion a population of man
only attractive to other men
some proportion what relation the women
we're only attractive
the other women
when people talk about sexual orientation care
it's important to realize
we're not talking here
about behavior
how does all sorts of reason
why somebody might have sex
would somebody of the same sex
you know
there might be more
you mate you know
determine to be whatever
the question is what he wanted
all fifty what what
what sort of for sleepy good beat sexually a romantically involved
with any person
who wouldn't they
and most people are heterosexual
there's a considerable amount of barry's crossed culture early
people who are bisexual
but the real puzzle is
whose of homosexuality
so why
well
nobody knows
we know some reasons
some answers are probably not right
on
it is not the case
almost certainly
maybe there's some exceptions but is not the case
he will choose or sexual orientation
on
i'm not gonna do this in this room
if i ask people the razor has the
how many people
decided
who becomes sexually attracted to
very few people would
tom
participation rises in fact at
people who are gay are often it's
really discriminate again
annette no wish to be gave him a vegas moral
all
for them to be that way
that makes it impossible
better sexual orientation is a contest
choice
what about up
experience after puberty
so there's there's a new it keeps coming up or vern over again a literature
people are gay
of some sentenced
seduced
by people by other people
are something happen afterwards
bomb
this seems unlikely
i there are
on
in particular the seeds of of sexually occasion later on in law
c. to show up
quite early in life
again the studies are sort of suspected are some reasonably
will
who are gay and people who are straight are different
long before they puberty
with regard her sexual and romantic
fantasies
he would now expect me to say
well
being gay and being straight is built minutes
hard why are
none of these stories you right
this is rebuild them
an action that is
sort of
so if you do the standard behavioral genetic that
and and you by now know how to do them
you look for differences v mama's i got and dies i got a twins
you did adoption
ah tf
comparison you adopted siblings a biological siblings
answer is
yes
you find
that
there is some sort of
genetic predisposition
towards homosexuality
got
can't be entirely
genetic
one reason why we can't it can't be entirely genetic this
the find gay
and i have an identical to
the also my identical twin
will be gay
so than fifty percent
those are very high ought and there could average in the population
but
it was truly jeanette
hi early genetic
what should the number be
hundred percent is by cloning
he should be exactly as i am
and it's not
so we know then that some sort of experience
possibly prenatal experience
is what explains
why is it so
said before does a huge pas up
why's that such a huge
well
exclusive homosexuality is an evolutionary mystery
again
do not think it is carries a moral weight to it
out
what it does mean though is that it doesn't seem to follow as a biological adaptation
possible is not
why is it that some men have sex with men
as and a because i'm a have sex with men
a some to recreational thing are pair bonding or whatever
that's not the polls
possible is
why heather cement
don't wanna have sex
look women
similarly
why are the summit women who don't wanna have sex
with men
from evolutionary adapted standpoint
you would think that the genes that give rise to such a behavioral
tom
would be we get out
because creatures with that behavior typically
putting aside modern technology don't have off
and that's what makes it sex
counsel
so you're reading response for this week is
it's all that parcel
and i said early on in the course to reading response is be really easy
and is required recite back and
would that prove to be too boring
so
so to solve this deepest the wall puzzles
then rapids at the end is very important
on your account
whatever it is
should be are some relationship to the fact
as discussed in lectures in weeks
tom
we have about five or minutes
any questions of ops
yes
thank you very much
top
she likes will other jack

any questions a thought
that one
count yes
as a dupont on hold on
mom
that's a very good question because certainly around certain origin
give me two more minutes
certainly are after but the origin of sexual preference in humans
will be informed
what we do not wizard of many animals engage in
be a
engage in sex
members of their own sex
what i don't know
is whether you get fixed
schools of
i'm a sexual behavior
so i don't know what the radius
in on human pry mates for instance
crime age not one have sex
with members it off
okay
to you
all wednesday
