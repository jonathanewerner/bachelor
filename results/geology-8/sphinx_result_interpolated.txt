good well today we're gonna talk about them
mixing in di lucia newman e has something to the atmosphere
gases or particles
all what happens to
how is it makes them and to what degree does it get
diluted this is a subject that s
on
applications to rome
two men induced air pollution but also
to a large number of natural processes and atmosphere
ah so it's really
it's really a
several quite
fundamental ideas
and i can be thinking about either
small particles or gases
added to the atmosphere
basically something's gonna move with the air
and the
makes n hint away
articles are large enough of course
they might
gravitational e
fallout after while
and that effect would not be included
done the calculations on to your slime someone the particles
our small or the grunted gas so that it will just
move along with the
with the or itself
so hot these this case
there's a law that the
a natural but not
not so much
is it your honor can find valley
and a
you know the dimensions of the ballot or song dimensions of a
and the valley is kept in some way
r brittany air that its capped by
i mean version
now all o kg give a more careful
and physical
interpretation of and version
paul later on but
i'm version is defined as a layer of a air
in which the temperature increases with height
and for reasons that are not all clear from what i just said but will become clear
very difficult
for
mixing to work or across an version
conversion tends to
act almost like a rigid let it holds
air and clean cgs
all
up
below it
for
many were prevented from crossing
in this case a
traps that
traps is a
looms below the versions of
all up
leading that as only partially
fine concepts
for a moment
we all know than the volume of the air
into which the pollution from my will
power plant here is reached
the volume into which the substance
substance has mixed of them
a product of the two horizontal dimensions
l won in l to
and the depth of the layer that's the depth top of the version
the mass of the air into words of loomed as mixed
is this the product of the air density
and that bombing
a nest emit units of
children's
so here comes a very simple example let's say
over some period of time
we put an
fourteen
met jerk
tom's
although polluted
maybe it's
wall particles friction
or gas
a mentor to on your recall is a
thousand telegram slumber km that
and as i units as
forty
times ten the three children's
that's a mater polluted we've
what a mess quite a bit but
the depends on the problem were working
but say that the hors i'll dimensions of the valley are
can kilometers m one dimension
ten kilometers an z
in the other dimension
and that the depth to them version of one kilometer
shall that hobby
the o i'm
concentration
of the polluted is going to be a
the mass of a polluted
divided by the mass of the error into which it as mix
and what that definition appear but
be sure you get that in out
fine cost
from this case
as a mass ratio
the mass of polluted the give were added to the atmosphere
divided by the mass of the air
into which it as good as mb x
so here's the formula on
there's a mass o polluted that we added
forty times and three children's
and here's a mass of the air into which
next its the air density
while clyde times the volume of the air
l want valve to
found day so it's
ten kilometers x
preston meters
and kilometers again and one kilometer
to meters
you work all about the its or point four
trench tended the sex
keller grams per telegram
km cancel above salesman units
that's fine
or you can leave it as killer ranch for telegram
just to remind you what it is
telegram of pollution
mb extended assert number killer grams
her
all
of the air
under which you next soap
pomp
suns this is ten the minus six
and it's a mass ratio
i could also write this a zero point four
p p m ham
parts per million
by mass
per million the p mb air
first of the time the minus x
and the last m there
first to the fact that to mass
mass ridge
question depth
well because i've got hill i've got particular grams or particular grams of polluted mb
divided by the killer grams of hair under which it's been mixed
they could apply magic you could just lot o i wouldn't mind that all dead
cloud i sometimes like to keep it there
to remind myself of what the definitions
either way would be foam
the beef perfectly fine to cancel a
nor my concentration
third of a quantity of has has no units
but sometimes oleg to keep their distance a reminder yacht

we're looking
depth
law that's right so this was ten kilometers
in a kilometers a thousand meters
so the ten times the three give
for
and forth meters
yep

co
or as i on a mentions of the valley
it
well the product is or isn't he
his the area of the valve
but the l l one as a dimension c'mon direction
l tours a dimension the other
for one no the base area of the valley
it's all one consultant
other questions
yes
and of a fair i will
well mass of a or below the version is what's in the the monitor its the density of the air
times the volume of the year
and the vine as given by that product which you see written out
here
depth
steady get those are really clear doesn't actually been top are flux
another question thomas one
okay so
now we move the case through which is on confided nixon
we don't have this
pre determine valley
and bison version in which
we know things are gonna be trapped so we all know exactly
on would ahmed couldn't were putting n
i'm going use a same values i did
here
but we don't know
into what volume will it be next
but we're who assume that there's a certain marv turbulence
in this atmosphere
there's kind of mixing and spinning m
and
home
moving arrival that
and
we're going to find something called is
persian co workers
joy helpless decide
how fast to that
a added material will diffuse or will does
earths
into the atmosphere
call a capital k
and as units of meters
where'd per second
can you can estimate a magnitude for that quantity
whoa
in the fallen way you can take
typical turbulent velocity
but say their eddie's in this room
that are turning over
annette air speed as a certain fellas are one meter per second
and the o
any size
maybe any czar
filling
the space between the floor and the
seal and that's about four meters
hot so if i were the case of a typical speed were one meter per second
and the any size
for meters
that would give a dispersed mb corporation of
of for
meters square crust second subdued upright
get out given the right units
that s meters per second
the says meters
and so that's km give meter square percent a month that the product
so this is sometimes very difficult to determine
what that this person coefficient is gonna be for particular
but few can get a ross estimate
of if you can estimate the size of a eddie's
and the speed in which those eddie's are
r turning over disturbing
atmosphere
let's i somali know what that it
that
how fast will that mixed
things into the atmosphere
if i have a point source
sitting on the ground
a lot
one direction is as good as any other directions km x
to laughed
to the right hand opt
on equally fast
so it's garb
produce a kind of
atmosphere
polluted
a half sphere
growing in time
as a material diffuse is our word and local word an upward
on
and the radius of that hemisphere
is given by this one
square root
of the
persian coefficient times time
so the longer you wait
the larger
that hemisphere will be
and of course the more diluted
we'll be the blood mb because
come on a polluted and loss are continuing dead
i'm assuming the problem were worked out here
put and just a fixed amount polluted
and then gradually watch it
diluted self
as it makes into mixes and a larger and larger
all
all part of a atmosphere
so that what is that what is that say
because as a square root of time
that function
tall the square root function
a increases rapidly of furs
and any more slowly layer on
and that is the nature of turbulent the spurs
rapidly at first and then
more slowly
later on
and emit at that experiment if you vote
if you barn something in the kitchen and you're right there use mb out very quickly
on
couple meters away it takes
to
a lot longer to get there
and even further weight
i.'s even longer but not when hill it actually gets
slower and slower and slower than the advance of that
of that burns smell
of moves slower and slower s
as time progressed so
rapidly eff first
and and more slowly later on
cried how things
burns disperse away from
from their swords
so leslie carry out this example let's say
the disperse and coefficient on this day
is a hundred meters square crust second
and that the time we're gonna weight
after the polluted russell was suddenly put m
his set ten minutes
let's x hundred seconds
so the first thing is compute the radius of that atmosphere
of the contains the potent
square root of
one hundred times six hundred
an mats about the
to uttered in forty five meters
by the way
second units on the suns estimate give hill linked
how can that they hum
well
final apply this kind of time
the second third emit cancel wild
i'm going have meters squared
inside the square root
taking the square root actively units of meters
and that's just what i need
the be physically consistent with this quantity
r which is the radius
of a atmosphere so these units workout
nicely
how so the radius of that's going average ordered forty five meters
we wanna know the
the volume or the mass of a year
into which the polluted has sold
has spread so
r brittany or the form of for the air mass
it's the density of the air row
times the volume of
half of a sphere
you may recall the formula for a
the volume of a spheres
for thirds
hierarchy
well i've taken half of that because this is a
a hemisphere
the tap of a sphere so
it's two thirds
pirate q
i put the density of fronts like that the mass of the air
and is three point seven times done some telegram so
what i got height next
can
i'm going use the same sorcerer
i've mixed them out
four times ten the third killer grams of fluid much
hint or three point seven times tended the seventh
hill a grandfather
so the concentration is given by that racial
and it's one on one plunged to minus three
a again you could counsel let out or you could say
killer grams per killer and
telegram of fluid much
for killer gramm halt air
question us
mb
that's correct fits right
so in hung like a valley case for we kind of new from the
a national dimensions of the system
how big
the ha ha much loot
the delusion will be
here
we're after world
emitted based on the disperse in coefficient time
to laugh honestly
for longer times s can continue to grow
and this constant britain's emit less less watts
we haven't remove any
and e o mb
polluted
but we diluted it
into a larger and larger amount of air
yes

no hawk
i'm assuming that this is a
a small mater polluted relative to the year
so no the doesn't change the air density
it just makes is
the m
mixes and with the air
ozone r question
s

and so s are a good question question as
question is in the solid tells you
calm
what's going on generally within mats
fear it doesn't give you details
of what's inside the sphere intercourse
the mob alive
that i've described or
is not precisely true
if i were to plot
mom
concentration
cross this business
it would be very small outsider would begin to rise
smoothly
probably a maximum somewhere in the middle
and then decrease again
whereas what i've indicated to you
which is a little bit off
is of their would be zero outside
in uniform concentration inside
and then zero again outside
and i saw a zach the troops ric
you're and you're
your vision of what is actually more accurate mon
you'd be more of a continuous
distribution
large closer the source
smaller further weight but
this is a
on easy to compute
estimate
of all those concentration of the
you would not have a sharp boundary here
with
of this concentration inside
and zero also it would be alike that the b
moreover gradual
transition to the system of a proclamation to the real
conditions abyssal x one question
can suns
so there would be armed
thirty are concentration after time
six honored second you could
we do the crap edition for a later time and you get
a larger value in that the nominate or and therefore
smaller value
concentration that's the way
delusion works
anything else suns
okay an hour yet another element of complexity or
we're going air the for k three we're going ahead
papa when
so ms a wind blowing
in the system
so it's on can sign
no valley walls
but now there's a wind blowing
so i got to moore cartoons here
cloud there's a source maybe it's a a
what i meant beijing years not just an instant a news release a polluted
like i was in case one case to
but here i'm in beijing
a steady state
mb source of pain
like a power plant of putting out a certain mars smoke
from the stack
per unit time
continuously
if i out aside you
of that
and the wind is blowing from left to right
i would find that polluted would be confined
in a kind of a recall the sew up loom
chemo polluted
moving down strain
getting deeper
the further goes downstream
due to the turbulent mb exit
the fiat at top due of that same situation
here's a top to
there's a power plant there's a source
and when ocean left or right
now we see that plumb is spreading
in the horizontal dimensions as well
again by turbulent
nixon hinges persian
and if i was to slice this
here or here
and look at it
along the direction of the when
i had any
the cupboard justin's downstream x
typical a dom
look like a
half a circle
and the radius of that circa will be larger
the further down when that i go because dispersed ms
and largely map loom
further we get from sorts
so how would i work s what out
again a system matters computing
on
delusion but now this is us
steady state
pollution
and we're gonna have to take into account effective when
moving that material
don when soaked
a one of the the finer trench the time
the time it takes
pierre to go from rio
polluted source
to whatever x location were interested in
maybe or houses
five kilometers down wind of a power plant walden
x is gonna be five kilometers
and the time it takes
the air to get them up our plan to your oz is gonna be
x divided by the wind speed
when speed is capital you in this case
notice about the right units distance over a
distance
for time
and we're calculate units of time
on the radius
call this plough ms given by the same formerly an earlier
except on
now it's this transit time we put a and
to that for me
the to steady state situations those not changing in time
but yet there is this transit time the plays the role
of time in the original problem
so i'll put n x over t into the former
can i get k x
over you
square roots
for
this quantity are that you see in you g east
three
guy grams
question is
you is or when speed
p o typically of the meters per second
ah now bottle a the cross section what area of this plum
for a slice across likeness
it is half full circle
and you know the air in circles pirate square done so
buildup on cross circular is player squared
divided by to visit have
it's have a circle
now here comes water the trick is part of the
of the duration
annette assume what i know the source
strength
hand up
that's hamas blues be headed to the
air per unit time by the power plant
that might have units for example of
shall a grams per second
killer branch for small of smoke looks a
being added to the atmosphere
of every second
well as steady state
the amount of poland being added that the source
must be the same amount of being carried away by the way
and saw body claiming those two
i can derive a formula for the concentration
so this of the q step on really quite
a red which blooms being headed
to the red in which it's being carried away about the went so
on the left and sighs array which being added
this is a re which being carried away about when
domingo through this right inside
that's the air density that's when speed
that's the cross abyssal very of of the
gloom
and so that product by itself will sri things together
is the a moderate air per unit time passing
all
a weight
within the plum being carried down when bob and
an idea set them all by that time sir concentration
to convert that from and hair mass flux to a polluted
herman schwartz
so then solving this form of for concentration
ah i get
two times the source
of use
plug listeners well
two times a source
divided by the
density of the air divided by pi times k
times acts
and a mb
you're a while even hampshire to in your notes to check
units on us as well
for chapel
the units on the concentration weeks
eff previous
calculations are right
it'll be the killer grams per keller and if you prefer or
it'll have no units of all
and so all the units over your should cancel out
and of the one inch or two of your notes
to
to deal with that one very interesting fang
is that the velocity of the when canceled out
how did that happen
i had here because
of the rate of which
jerrold being blown down when is going a bit
portions the wind speed
but you see the radius
here
of the area
n.'s on our and our depends on you underneath
so when you square the radius you get a you underneath which counsels love so
and the of the width of the palms world
change
with when speed but not the concentration
within the plum and when you do
period o couple examples like this in your neck problem set in
when you're doing that
the my spend a few minutes
puzzling over
what was the role of the wind speed
the when's the very important as problem but
in that ticket or
formula
it is cancelled out intuition to resolve that
little dilemma
hollis the woods because important
how the cancel levin that particular for me
so
think of the above
above how that would work
question suns
yes
a is a
this whistling
across actual area of the poo
are square and over to the s

his the distance
between
the source of a potent and they
a location of the interest
your house or the
the school yard or the kids are playing a were
whatever it is meters and finding out
concentration is
the distance away from
lou km sorts
on this late
stefan
the went as from the west
and you're living down here somewhere
that plumb is not done it you at all
so this calculation is irrelevant
for you
so that when direction comes into this and a very important way also
i haven't mentioned that up till now but it's
probably quite obvious
the wind direction is a key player in us
it's only if the wind is blowing
generally
in that direction
trauma swords to your location
that this
calculation becomes relevant
to you
that's true that such sketches the top new
is getting wider
fast the first a man's law orbit
it never stops one keeps getting wider and wider and wider
for the you are down winslow that's true if you live
a great distance
down when
but not in exactly in the wind direction you might still get it
that the blue done
because the pollution will widened the poo
so keep keep track of that when you do these
calculation yes
ha source would be they
ray which balloon is being added to the atmosphere
how are on looks
good b a n i units of
on
telegram spur second but
particles
on that could be the number of particles per second
being in
and then your concentration would have to be in the appropriate
by were that's a curve ball i've given you
on the problem sept
i think i gave you earths problem which
all
who was a source was quoted as a number particles per second
and so the concentration
van was in units of particles prick of a meter
rather than keller grams
for q kg meter
so just be wary out eff consist units
when units
okay now wearily that there are no not true another aspect of mixing
palm
which is very important also
and that's the role of a
of the temperature laps rich
all
so i called this action lapse radiant winds effects
first of all water defined what i mean by the laughter
laughter and is a rate of change of temperature with height
if you've washing alone
and get that data back
can measured of
the eyes of temperature
with height
and i'm
you can the final out sir
as units typically of
degrees l serious per meter
ward rapture would wanna use degrees else's per kilometer
basically
how fast of the temperature
change in the atmosphere
as you go up and down
typically in neutral this fear your member
depth colder
as you go up
and average value
farm using or lower the gamma for this
typical lecture to the procured
it is about six mb a half degrees
on
sell cirrus per kilometer
on air verge
a reply maria go up because above six men have
degrees but don't take that to let us assume average sometimes it's
so
very different than that
sometimes it even positive
for example in and burning abroad a fine and version
conversion was a
a layer were the temperature increased height well of me
positive laps for
instead of a negative
so for some layer is and then in the stratosphere remember
you have a positive lecture the temperature goes warmer
as you go up
the i really important quantity has a
a marv earth a radical one but it's equally important
it's the thea bad a collapse for
this is the lapse or a better parcel of eric's
baron says
when hint rises
why would the
temperature of an air parcel change
when rises well it's pretty
from the straightforward
are mb when you think air parcel of a certain volume
and lift it
you know the pressure decrease is as you go up so
when you left a parcel op
corner expand a little bit
the list of further its can expand
to inflow more
and when air expands
it does work on its environment are pressing out
an expanding
the decrease is a amount of energies
stuart in the parcel
because it's done work on environment
and if temperature drops
it's called a a ballot expansion work any better cooling
the word any of that a cure
means
without adding heat
a lot and mars tracking heat
and you may wonder how can i change the temperature without an equal
the point is i'm doing
i'm change in the temperature by adding a parcel
do work on its informant
not by adding heat from some
energy source
curly a mechanical process
of expanding the air
and watching it cool
cause of that the the gigs
trench
quite a powerful from of fact as you'll see in just a moment
so they backlash earths vines a rate of cooling
as in her parcel rises
it is a reversal ball phenomena so
our soul
thanks
back down in the atmosphere
class
and it's temperature will increase
at the same break
on
all use capital gamma for this quantity
eighty a battered flattery
the can be compute a the racial that saw origin or gravity
to the capacity of the air
this were course on determine mt x r would arrive that for you
on
have for a
the earth
and are
harp atmosphere made of air
the values about nine point three
minus
nine point three times an a minus
three
of degrees else's per meter
or express imagine
can
kilometers
to bob minus
nine point it the minus one there
minus nine point eight
of degrees else's
club question
later passive constant pressure for air
you could look up and
table of
table of flux a little constance
you can go out
how its values about a thousand and
for the
and so i units
cobb
so i top i have to confess i'm a law that sloppy
that number so close to ten
that i very often rom that off
ten i'm doing quick
quick calculations
and i've done out here michael example
but set i got air at sea level that sept ten degrees else's
and i move that up and the atmosphere three kilometers
three thousand meters
what temperature will a deanna
when it reaches the higher elevation well
eff around that often can
cooling ten degrees for every kilometer that i left it
so it's gonna cooled by thirty degrees l cirrus approximately
thirty results a
please i'll ask you not to do that rounding and above mb sept
levy nine point eight that can
on
but for the purposes of illustration
cool by
approximately thirty degrees
sell cirrus
it starts at ten
so stony minus twenty sells this when it gets
to
all
three connors you can do that and tell them to swell work of the senate the start set
can increased
of
shall cirrus estimate the truth k d three
columns
friendship tractor a from us
can be true
fifty three
felons
when it gets up there sodium i want football to sell cirrus
and the kelvin to new notes to be sure
you're clear on a question

all
that's right i drive l weight
her mind is that
the reason it's cooled
because it has expanded
it moved into or
a region where the pressure was less
and therefore it naturally cgs
and
because of the lowered pressure
question
now solitude the suns ensemble doesn't matter the size of a parcel
just a mb
that elevation differences will of manners that tells you
how much on a relative bases in a six
and a
and therefore
tom tommy degree selfishness cool
a member i said this is reversal
if i take that parcel a moment back down hill compressed
back down to its original volume
and l returned to its original temperature
so it's a reversal process
the question is whether we're assuming it was on the ground known on a cicero and
this would happen
started an a elevation and move it to any other
l others
so
this is independent aware the ground was are just
and to give you an example with the ground
job water lifting
the matter where you started
we give you an approximate
three
thirty rates else's
cool
questions on that
okay now
which resented this an calculations them
of what happens there as you move up and down in a atmosphere
using these two concepts
they measured laps for it
and the a bad aqua q soak
normally emit textbooks hill cigar grams like this work
senators and put an x. axis
altitude been put on the wire suns
and on
some reference lines are drawn on here
with a slope given by capital gamma
and that i draw an a black curve which represents the actual lapse rates
on the day
under consideration
but say we've lost a balloon
measured temperature is a function of height
an dollar cloud that up as a black woman
now the question is what's gonna happen to enter parcel
has its moved upwards or downwards
in this kind of a situation
if i'd taken or parcel
from the celebration
and lift that

it's gonna cool
it's gonna cooled
moving along the best blue curves
possessing any better cloud for so
this partial one i take it out of it's environment and lifted a little whiz
can a move along like this
new elevation
this new temperatures going to be fair
and the temperature of its new environment
his going to be there
here's the tricky part of this argument
when you tank and air parcel and left it
gets cooling at one rates
its environment
his changing had a differently
and we're interested in knowing after we lifted a certain amount
what is s temperature relative to the environment
it's new
that there that's not next
to
in this case
the parcel went to that temperature
cobb
good mood in the cooler air above
but
that wasn't such a great effect imagine the parcel was now
colder
jan
it's new environment
environment cooled
a parcel cooled
parcel cooled more
so the parcel is not cold relative to its new environment
what's gonna happen to that parcel
can a sank
because if more dense than its mb farm
so i lifted up there
it looks arises or my lord i'm
then sir that everything appear
back down i go i top along in this crowd
i gotta go back
i'm hon native lee boy
i'm heading
a menacing back
you can or did you could push that parcel down in a atmosphere
little moved to hear
there's a new temperature
there's a new temperature of and cuts in farm and
palm
it's not going to date book
got warmer as it went down
the environment are warmer true but a co warmer fast
faster
therefore gets warmer than evst new environment
it's now boy at
it's gonna water bob backup
to its original condition
this is call a stable atmosphere
the storm is very mb for this is called us
table atmosphere because
parcel that is on
lifted upwards wants to send back down
arthur was pushed down mars to bob backup
and though
the atmosphere is usually a mistake but
not all its
a one to look at the second example
here
which is up
again temperature plot a versus altitude
the same
reference law and the been drawn on or for capital gamma
but i put a deferred
actual laps ridge
on that curve
it's a o of
let's rates were the temperature increases with height
often this is an example halt
on version
conversion
i think a parcel from here
and left at
gets colder
i'm imitated from an old ocean of the l g
there's a parcel temperature
it's actually been moving into warmer air order
so the new environment is there
so this is an extreme example
of stability
this is a very stable unborn
were the parcel gets colder as you got the environment depth warmer
and so you develop his
restoring forces this
tennessee for the
parcel to water quickly removed
go back to where was
r o
and the fight in this case
because of the and version
that's the reason why
air cannot mixes actively
through an and version
the z are pro souls water cool is they're ours
and yet there's warmer air aloft
two things
ed to each other
making it virtually impossible for persons to mix or ports
for downwards that matter
the air tends to lay him
in stable layers
gratified stable ers with
very little turbulent mixing
in a
situation like this
now hobby
the situation that i don't believe you can
hill and your notes
do one last case were not
till this
kermit over
so it's

flatter than made reference groups
please mb space in you know to this
take that observed temperature the black line
