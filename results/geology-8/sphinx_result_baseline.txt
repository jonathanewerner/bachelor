good well today we're gonna talk about them
mixing in di lucia winnie has something to the atmosphere
gases or particles
ah what happens to
how is it makes them to what degree does it get
diluted this is a subject of us
hon
applications to rome
two men brewster pollution but also
to a large number of natural processes in the atmosphere
ah so it's really
it's really a
several quite
fundamental ideas
and i can be thinking about either
small particles or gases
added to them sir
basically something's gonna move with the air
and duh
makes n. n. away
articles are large enough of course
they might
gravitational it
fallout after while
and that effect would not be included
in the calculations on to your slime someone the particles
our small or the grunted desolate it will just
move along with the
with your self
sol hobby this case
there's a low but them
a natural but not
not so much
is it your honor can find valley
and uh
you know the dimensions of the ballot or song dimensions of what
and the valley is kept in some way
our britain here that it's capped by
i mean version
now all load give a more careful
and physical
interpretation of an version
paul later on but
but in person is defined as a layer of air
in which the temperature increases with height
and for reasons that are not all clear from what i just said but will become clear
very difficult
for
mixing to work or across an version
conversion tends to
act almost like a rigid let it holds
care and blooms
all
oh
below it
cor
and then you are prevented from crossing
in this case it
traps that
traps is a
looms bloated version silk
all up
leading that as only partially
fine concepts
for a moment
we all know than the volume of the air
into which the pollution from my will
power plant here is reached
the volume into which the substance
substance has mixed with them
a product of the two horizontal dimensions
el won in hell too
and the depth of the layer that's a duck copper the version
the mass of the air into words of loomed as mixed
is this the product of the air density
and that bombing
and that's gonna units of
children's
so here comes a very simple example let's say
over some period of time
we put in
fourteen
met jerk
tom's
although polluted
maybe it's
wall particles friction
or gas
a magic on your call is a
thousand telegram slung brick mat
in a psi units as
forty
times ten and three children shh
that's a mater polluted with
what a mess quite a bit but
in depends on the problem we're working
but say that the hors i'll dimensions of the valley are
ten kilometers in one dimension
ten kilometers in the
in the other dimension
and that the doubts that in version of one kilometer
so than a hobby
the o.
concentration
of the polluted is going to be a
the mass of a polluted
divided by the mess of the error into which it as mix
and what that definition appear but
be sure you get that unannounced
fine concert
from this case
as a mass ratio
the mass of polluted that you've added to the atmosphere
divided by the mass of the air
into which it as good as mix
so here's a formal or palm
there's a mass of polluted that we added
forty times in the three children's
and here's a mass of the air into which
next it's the air density
while clyde times the volume of new york
al want all too
gandhi swords
ten kilometers aches
preston meters
ten kilometers again and one kilometer
two meters
you work all about the its or point four
punch tended to sex
keller grams per telegram
could just love salesman units
that's fine
or you can leave it as a telegram for telegram
just to remind you what it is
telegram of pollution
mixed into a certain number killer grams
her
all
of the air
under which you next soap
pomp
since this is tender minus six
and it's a mass ratio
i could also write this a zero point four
p. p. m. ham
parts per million
by mess
per million to p m there
first of the time the mind of sex
and the last put them there
first to the fact that it's a mass
a mass ridge
question it
well because i've got kill i've got particular grams or particular grams of polluted
divided by the killer grams of hair under which it's been mixed
they could apply magic you could just lot all i wouldn't mind that all dead
but i sometimes like to keep it there
to remind myself of what the definitions
either way would be fung
the beef perfectly fine to cancel about
nor my concentration
sir did a quantity of as has no units
but sometimes oleg to keep their distance remind me up

we're looking
yep
well that's right so this was ten kilometers
in a kilometers a thousand meters
so the ten times the three gifts
for
and forth meters
yep
ah
oh
or as i own a mentions of the valley
it
well the product is or isn't he
his imperial valley
but the l. l. won as a dimension c'mon direction
al tours a dimension in the other
she won all the base area of the valley
it's all one consultant
other questions
yes
end of the fair eye wall
well massive air below the version is what's in the the monitor it's the density of the air
times the volume of the year
and the vine as given by that product which you see written out
here
yep
it's good to get those are really clear doesn't actually been proper poets
another question from a swan
okay so
now we move the case through which is on confided nixon
we don't have this
pre determined valley
and bison version in which
we know things are gonna be trapped so we all know exactly
on when ahmed couldn't we're putting n.
i'm going to uses same values i did
here
but we don't know
into what volume will it be next
but we're who assume that there's a certain marv turbulence
in this that fear
there's kind of mixing and spinning him
and
home
moving arrival that
and who
we're going to find something called us
persian cultures
she'll help us decide
how fast the vat
a added material will diffuse or will does
first
into the atmosphere
call a capital k.
and as units of meters
where'd per second
and you can estimate a magnitude for that quantity
whoa
in the fallen way you can take
typical turbulent velocity
but say their eddie's in this room
that are turning over
annette air speed as a certain fellas are one year per second
and the o.
any size
maybe a czar
filling
the space between the floor and a
seal and that's about four meters
hot so if i were the case of a typical speed were one meter per second
any any size
four meters
that would give a dispersed the cooperation of
for
we're squared per second subdued upright
get out given the right units
as meters per second
the says meters
and so that's gonna give me your square percent a month that the product
so this is sometimes very difficult to determine
what that this person corporation is gonna be for particular
but you can get a raw fasting month
bob if you can estimate the size of a eddie's
and the speed in which those eddie's are
are turning over disturbing
mr
let's i somali know what that it
that
how fast will that mix
things into the atmosphere
if i have a point source
sitting on the ground
a lot
one direction is as good as any other directions coming next
to laughed
so the right hand opt
cause equally fast
so it's garb
produce a kind of woe
hemisphere
polluted
a half sphere
growing in time
as a material diffuse is our word and all our word and upward
hum
and the radius of that hemisphere
is given by this one
where route
lovely
persian gulf version times time
so the longer you wait
the larger
that hemisphere will be
and of course the more diluted
we'll be the poland because
tomato polluted and muster continuing dead
i'm assuming a prominent honor worked out here
put in just a fixed amount polluted
and then gradually watch it
guy loot itself
as it makes into mixes and a larger and larger
all
all part of the atmosphere
so that was that what is that say
because as a square root of time
that function
tall discourage function
a increases rapidly it first
and then more slowly later on
and that is the nature of jordan does version
rapidly it first and then
more slowly
later on
and you may have had that experience if you vote
if you barn something in the kitchen and you're right there you smell a very quickly
ah
couple meters away it takes
so
a lot longer to get there
and even further way
i.'s even longer but not mentally it actually gets
slower and slower and slower than the advance of that
of that burns smell
a moves slower and slower as
as time progressed insult
rapidly it first
and they're more slowly later on
cried foul things
burns disperse away from
from their swords
so leslie carry out this example let's say
the disperse and prohibition on this day
is a hundred meters squared per second
and that the time we're gonna wake
after the polluted russell was suddenly put em
his foot ten minutes
all that six hundred seconds
so the first thing this computer radius of that hemisphere
of the contains the potent
where rudolph
one hundred times six hundred
annette about though
to uttered in forty five meters
by the way
check the units on the says is gonna give you a link
how can that be a hum
well
final apply this kind of time
the second they're going to cancel wild
i'm gonna have meters squared
inside the square root
taking the square root actively units of meters
and that's just what i need
to be physically consistent with this quantity
our which is the radius
of the hemisphere so these units workout
nicely
ah so the rate is so that's gonna ridge ordered forty five meters
we wanna know they
the volume or the mass of a year
into which the polluted has sold
has spread so
our brittany are performing for the air mass
it's the density of the air row
times the volume of
half of a sphere
you may recall the formula for a
the volume of the spheres
for thirds
hierarchy
well i've taken half of that because this is a
i hemisphere
the tap of a sphere or so
it's two thirds
pirate cube
i put the density of fronts like that the mass of the air
and is three point seven times ten some telegram soap
what i got hive next
can
i'm going to use the same sorcerer
i've mixed them out
four times that of the third killer grams of fluid moods
into three point seven times tended the seventh
so a grandfather
so the concentration is given by that racial
and at one point one plunged to minus three
ah again you could counsel let out or you could say
programs for children
telegram of fluid much
for telegram healthcare
question us
i'm
that's correct that's right
so in hung like a valley case for we kind of new from a
a national dimensions of the system
how big
the ha ha much loot
the delusion will be
here
we have to love
automated based on the disperse into a persian time
to laugh honestly
for longer times s. can continue to grow
and this concentrated in the blessed less watts
we haven't remove any
any yo
polluted
but we diluted it
into a larger and larger amount of air
yes
i
no hawk
i'm assuming that this is a
a small mater polluted relative to the year
so note that doesn't change the urgency
it just mixes
him
mixes and with the air
was another question
yes
ah
and so lesser good question question is
question is in the solid tells you
calm
what's going on generally within mats
fear it doesn't give you details
of what's inside the sphere intercourse
the mob alive
that i've described or
is not precisely true
if i were to plot
mom
concentration
cross this business
it would be very small outsider would begin to rise
smoothly
probably a maximum somewhere in the middle
and then decrease again
whereas what i've indicated to you
which is a little bit off
is that there would be zero outside
in uniform concentration inside
and then zero again outside
and i saw a zach the troops ric
you're in europe
your vision of that is actually more accurate than mon
you'd be more of a continuous
distribution
large closer the source
smaller further way but
this is a
on easy to computer
estimates
of all those concentration of d.
you would not have a sharp boundary here
with
of this concentration inside
and zero also it would be like that could be
moreover gradual
transition to the system of a proclamation to the real
condition cynical question
gentleness
so there would be armed
thirty or concentration after time
six hundred second you could
we do they got petition for a later time and you get
a larger value in that the nominate her and therefore
smaller value
concentration that's the way
delusion works
anything else on this
ok our yet another element of complexity or
organ added the fer case three we're going ahead
papa wind
so those of wind blowing
in the system
so it's contents signed
no valley walls
but now there's a wind blowing
so i got to moore cartoons here
ah there's a source maybe it's a
what i meant beijing years not just an instant genius really supplement
like i was in case one case too
but here i'm in beijing
a steady state
source of pain
like a power plant of putting out a certain amount of smoke
from the stack
per unit time
continuously
if i had a side view
of that
in the wind is blowing from left to right
i would find that polluted would be confined
in a kind of what we call the sew up loom
chemo polluted
moving down strain
getting deeper
the further goes downstream
drew the target of mexico
the fiat atop a ou of that same situation
here's the top two
there's a power plant there's a source
and when the shun left or right
now we see that plumb is spreading
in the horizontal dimensions as well
again by target
nixon hinges persian
and if i was to slice this
here or here
and look at it
along the direction of the when
i had any
the cupboard justin's downstream x.
it would dom
look like a
half a circle
and the radius of that circa will be larger
the further down when that i go because this person is
and largely map loom
further we get from sorts
so how would i work this one out
again a system matters computing
aw
delusion but now this is us
many states
pollution
and we're gonna have to take into account effective whim
moving that material
don when soaked
uh one of the define a trance account
the time it takes
pierre to go from rio
polluted source
to whatever ex location were interested in
maybe your houses
five kilometers down wind of a power plant walden
this is gonna be five kilometers
and the time it takes
the air to get them up our plan to your oz is gonna be
ex divided by the wind speed
when speeches capital you in this case
notice about the right in it's distance over a
distance
for time
gonna work out the units of time
on the radius
call this plum is given by the same form that we had earlier
except on
now it's this transit time we put in
to that for me
it's a steady state situations those not changing in time
but yet there is this transit time the plays the role
of time in the original problem
so i'll put an x. over tea into the format
can i get a acts
over you
where roots
for
this quantity are that you see in each of these
three
guidelines
question is
you as a wednesday
the typically of the meters per second
ah now bottle either cross section one area of this plum
ford's slides across like this
it is half full circle
and you know the air in the circle is pirates word and so
buildup on cross circular is player squared
divided by two visits half
with half a circle
now here comes probably the trick is part of the
of the duration
and there is someone i know the source
strength
hand up
that's hamas blues being added to the
they're per unit time by the power plant
that might have unit for example of
fella grams per second
killer grams per smoke will smoke would say
being added to the atmosphere
on every second
well as steady state
the amount of poland being added that the source
must be the same amount of being carried away by the way
and saw body claiming those two
i can derive a formula for the concentration
so the civic you step on the newly quake
the red which blooms being headed
to the red which it's being carried away about when salt
on the left and sighs array which being added
this is a re which it's being carried away about when
i'm a go through this right inside
that's the air density that's wednesday
that's the cross section wary of lovely
gloom
and so that product by itself will sri things together
is the amount of care per unit time passing
home
away
within the plum being carried down wimbledon
another set them all by that time sir concentration
to convert that from an air mass flex to a polluted
herman schwartz
so then solving this form of four concentration
ah i get
two times a source
on tuesday
plug listeners well
two times a source
divided by the
density of the air divided by pi times k.
times acts
and the um
you're a won only one inch or two in your notes to checked
the units on us as well
for chapel
the units on the concentration weeks
if previous
calculations are right
it'll be the killer grams per keller and if you prefer or
it'll have no units of all
and so all units over your should cancel out
and on the one inch or two of your notes
to
to deal with that one very interesting fang
is that the velocity of the when canceled out
how did that happen
i had here because
on the rate of which
jerrold being blown down when his gun a bit
portions of the wind speed
but you see the radius
here
all the area
n.'s on r. and r. depends on you underneath
so when you square the radius you get a u. underneath which counsels love so
and the of the width of the home world
change
with wednesday but not the concentration
within the plum and when you do
weirdo couple examples like this in your neck problem set in
when you're doing that
the my spend a few minutes
puzzling over
what was the role of the wind speed
the when's the very important as problem but
in that ticket or
formula
it is cancelled out intuition to resolve that
little dilemma
hollis the wind speed is important
harder cancel out in that particular form
so
think of that about
about how that would work
question zones
yes
a is a
this whistling
across actual area of the poo
because our squared over to this
it
it is the distance
between
the source of a potent and they
a location of the interest
your house or the
the school yard really kids are planning to work
whatever it is the cheers of finding out
concentration is
the distance away from
lou sorts
on this late
this fall
the went as from a west
and you're living down here somewhere
that long was not done it you at all
so this calculation is irrelevant
for you
so that when direction comes into this and a very important way also
i haven't mentioned that up till now but it's
probably quite obvious
the wind direction is a key player in us
it's only if the wind is blowing
generally
in that direction
trauma swords to your location
that this
calculation becomes relevant
to you
that's true that such sketches the top new
he is getting wider
fastest first a man's law orbit
it never stops widening keeps getting wider and wider and wider
further you are down winslow that's true if you live
a great distance
down when
but not in the exactly in the wind direction you might still get it
that the blue done
because the pollution will widened the poo
so keep keep track of that when you duties
calculation yes
ha source would be a headache
ray which balloon is being added to the atmosphere
how are appointments
could be a night units of
on
killer grams per second but
particles
are there could be the number of particles per second
being in
and then your concentration would have to be in the appropriate
by where that's a curve ball i've given you
on the problems that
i think i gave you was probably which
home
who was a source was quoted as a number of particles per second
and so the concentration
and then was in units of particles prick a big meter
rather than keller grams
for cupid
so just be wary active consists in units
when you do this
okay now wearily that there are no not true another aspect of nixon
palm
which is very important also
and that's the role of late
of the temperature laps rich
home
so i called this action laps rate in boy ensued sex
first of all wanted to find what i mean by the laps hurry
laughter and is a rate of change of temperature with height
if you've washing alone
and get that data back
can measure the irv
the eyes of temperature
with heights
and though
you can define a lobster
as units typically of
degrees sell serious per meter
ward perhaps you would want his degrees else's per kilometer
basically
off fast as the temperature
change in the atmosphere
as you go up and down
typically in neutral this fear your member
gets colder
as you go up
hammond average value
funny isn't york lower gamma for this
typical lecture to the troubles here
it is about six and a half degrees
on
sell serious per kilometer
hot air verge
a reply maria go up because about six men have
degrees but don't take that your letter that system ever sometimes it's
so
very different than that
sometimes it even positive
for example in and burning abroad defined in version
conversion was a
a layer were the temperatures increasing pipe well i would name
positive lobster
instead of a negative
so for some layers and then in the stress to remember
you have a positive lecturing the temperature goes warmer
as you go up
the other really important quantity as a
a more rest a radical one but it's equally important
it's the thea bad a collapse for
this is the lapse or a better parcel of eric's
baron says
when can't rises
why would the
temperature of an air parcel change
when rises well it's pretty
from the straightforward
arm when you think our parcel of a certain volume
and lift it
you know the pressure decrease is as you go up so
when you left a parcel op
corner expand a little bit
the list of further tim expand
jim kill more
and when eric's hands
it does work on its environment are pressing out
an expanding
the decrease is a amount of energies
stuart in the parcel
because it's done work on the environment
and it's temperature drops
it's called abe addict expansion work any better cooling
the word any of that i cure
means
without adding heat
not anymore so tracking heat
and you may wonder how can i change the temperature without an equal
the point is i'm doing
i'm changing the temperature by adding a parcel
do work on its informant
not by adding heat from song
energy source
curly a mechanical process
of expanding the air
and watching it cool
cause of that idiot better ticks
branch
quite a powerful full fact as you'll see in just a moment
so they backlash traitors vines a rate of cooling
as in her parcel rises
it is a reversal ball phenomena so
our soul
thanks
back down in the atmosphere
press
and it's temperature will increase
at the same break
hon
i'll use capital gamma for this quantity
idiot that flattery
it can be completed as a racial that saw origin or gravity
to the capacity of the air
those were course on fuhrman maddox our would arrive that for you
home
i have for it
the earth
and our
our pet mr made a pair
the values about nine point three
minus
nine point three times in the mines
three
of degrees else's per meter
or expressing madam
in
kilometers
to bob minus
nine pointed to minus one there
minus nine point eight
of degrees else's
club question
later passive constant pressure for here
you could look up and
table of
table of fluffy little constance
you can go out
outs values about a thousand tons
for the
and so i units
cobb
so i hope i have to confess i'm a low but sloppy
that number so close to ten
that i very often rom that off
ten when i'm doing quick
quick calculations
and i've done that here are my little example
let's say i've got air at sea level that took ten degrees else's
and i move that up in the atmosphere three kilometers
three thousand meters
what temperature will it be asked
when it reaches the higher elevation well
if around that often tan
cooling ten degrees for every kilometer that i left it
so it's gonna cooled by thirty degrees else's approximately
thirty resulted
please i'll ask you not to do that rounding under prom sets
levy nine point eight napkin
hon
but for the purposes of illustration
cool body
approximately thirty degrees
self service
it starts at ten
so stony minus twenty sells this when it gets
to
all
three connors you can do that and tell them to swell work of the senate to start said
ten degrees
ah
sell sis of scum of the truth eighty three
columns
and some crack thirty from us
could be true
fifty three
felons
when it gets up there sodium i want football to sell sis
and the kelvin to new notes to be sure
you're clear on that question
it
all
that's right i brought up that late
her mind is that
the reason it's cooled
because it has expanded
it moved into warp
a region where the pressure was less
and therefore it naturally
and
because of the lowered pressure
question
now solace in the silas ensemble doesn't matter the size of a parcel
just a new
that elevation difference is all that matters that tells you
how much on a relative bases in a sixth
and uh
and therefore
tom tommy degree selfishness cool
a member i said this is reversal
if i take that parcel a moment back down hill compressed
back down to its original volume
and though returned to its original temperature
so it's a reversal process
the question is whether we're assuming it was on the ground no not a cicero it
this would happen
started ellie elevation and move it to any other
al others
so
this is independent aware the ground was i just
and to give you an example with the ground
kilometer lifting
no matter where you started
we give you an approximate
three
thirty reese else's
cool
questions on that
okay now
which resented this in calculations them
of what happens there as you move up and down in a atmosphere
using these two concepts
they measured laps for it
and the aided adequate for soaked
normally in the textbooks you'll see diagram flight this work
senators and put an x. axis
hello tubes been put on the wire axis
and on
some reference lines are drawn on here
with a slope given by capital gamma
and that i've drawn in a black curve which represents the actual laps route
on the day
under consideration
but say we've lost a balloon
measure temperature is a function of hype
and dollar plow that up as a black woman
now the question is what's gonna happen to enter parcel
as it's moved upwards or downwards
in this kind of a situation
if i'd taken or parcel
from the celebration
and lift it

it's gonna cool
it's gonna cooled
moving along the best blue curves
possessing any better collapsed or so
this partial wanna take it out of it's environment and lifted a little whiz
gonna move along like this
new elevation
this new temperatures going to be fair
and the temperature of its new environment
his going to be there
here's the tricky part of this argument
when you take it or parcel and left it
gets cooling at one rate
it's environment
his changing had a differently
and we're interested in knowing after we lifted a certain amount
what is this temperature relative to the environment
it's new
that there that's not next
to
in this case
the parcel went to that temperature
cobb
good mood in the cooler air above
but
that wasn't such a great effect in action the parcel was now
colder
jan
it's new environment
the garment cooled
a parcel cooled
parcel cooled more
so the parcel is not cold relative to its new environment
what's gonna happen to that parcel
tuna sank
because if more dense than anson farm
so i lifted up there
it looks arises or my lord i'm
then sir that everything appear
back down i go i don't belong in this crowd
i gotta go back
i'm hon native lee boy
i'm heading
i'm innocent back
you can or did you could push that parcel down in the atmosphere
little moved to hear
there's a new temperature
there is a new temperature month cups environment
palm
it's not going to date book
got warmer as it went down
the environment are warmer true but ago warmer fast
faster
therefore hitch in warmer than its new environment
it's now boy at
it's been a water bob backup
to its original condition
this is call a stable atmosphere
the storm is rare in court this is called us
table hap mr because
parcel that is on
lift that upwards wants to send back down
arthur was pushed down wants to bob back up
and though
the atmosphere is usually a mistake but
not all us
i want to look at the second example
here
which is up
again temperature plot a versus altitude
the same
reference slime the been brought honor for capital down
but i put a deferred
actual laps ridge
on that curve
it's salem
let's red were the temperature increases with holly
often this is an example halt
and version
conversion
by take a parcel from here
and left it
gets colder
i'm imitated from medal wishing to them will she
there is a parcel temperature
it's actually been moving into warmer air order
so the new environment is there
so this is an extreme example
of stability
this is a very stable unborn
where the parcel gets colder as you got the bar mutt gets warmer
and so you develop his
restoring forces this
tennessee for the
parcel to wanna quickly removed
go back to where was
our row
and the fight in this case
because of the abortion
that's the reason why
character not mix effectively
through an end version
there's a are pro souls water cool is they're ours
and yet there's warmer air aloft
two things
had to each other
making it virtually impossible for persons to mix upwards
for downwards that matter
here tends to lay him
in stable layers
gratified stable ers with
very little trouble of mixing
in a
situation like this
now hobby
the situation that i don't believe you can
bill and your notes
you one last case we're not
