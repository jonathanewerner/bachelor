well today we're going to talk about mixing and dilution when you add something to the atmosphere gases or particles what happens to it how does it mix in to what degree does it get diluted this is a subject that has applications to human-induced air pollution but also to a large number of natural processes in the atmosphere so it's really a set of quite fundamental ideas and i could be thinking about either small particles or gases added to the atmosphere basically something that's going to move with the air and mix in in a way if the particles are large enough of course they might gravitationally fall out after awhile and that effect would not be included in the calculations i'm doing here so i'm assuming the particles are small or it's a gas so that it will just move along with the air itself so the easiest case maybe it's a little bit unnatural but not so much is that you're in a confined valley and you know the dimensions of the valley horizontal dimensions of the valley and the valley is capped in some way i've written here that it's capped by an inversion now i'll give a more careful and physical interpretation of inversion later on but an inversion is defined as a layer of air in which the temperature increases with height and for reasons that are not at all clear from what i've just said but will become clear it's very difficult for mixing to occur across an inversion an inversion tends to act almost like a rigid lid it holds air and pollutants below it or in any way prevents it from crossing in this case it traps these pollutants below the inversion so leaving that as only partially defined concept for a moment we'll know then the volume of the air into which the pollution from my little power plant here has reached the volume into which the substance has mixed is then the product of the two horizontal dimensions l~1~ and l~2~ and the depth of the layer that's the depth up to the inversion the mass of the air into which the pollutant has mixed is just the product of the air density and that volume and that's going to have units of kilograms so here comes a very simple example let's that over some period of time we put in 40 metric tons of a pollutant maybe it's small particles for example or a gas a metric ton you recall is a thousand kilograms so i've written that in si units as 40x10^3^ kilograms that's the amount of pollutant we've put in that's quite a bit but it depends on the problem we're working on let's say that the horizontal dimensions of the valley are 10 kilometers in one dimension and 10 kilometers in the other dimension and that the depth to the inversion is one kilometer so then the concentration of the pollutant is going to be the mass of the pollutant divided by the mass of the air into which it has mixed i didn't put that definition up here but be sure you get that in your notes we're defining concentration in this case as a mass ratio the mass of pollutant that you've added to the atmosphere divided by the mass of the air into which it has mixed so here's the formula then there's the mass of pollutant that we added 40x10^3^ kilograms and here's the mass of the air into which it mixed it's the air density multiplied times the volume of the air l~1~ l~2~ times d so it's 10 kilometers expressed in meters 10 kilometers again and one kilometer expressed in meters you work all that out you get 0 4x10^-6^ kilograms per kilogram you could cancel it out and say it has no units that's fine or you could leave it as kilograms per kilogram just to remind you what it is it's a kilogram of pollutant mixed into a certain number of kilograms of the air into which you mixed it so since this is 10^-6^ and it's a mass ratio i could also write this as 0 4 ppmm parts per million by mass the per million the pm there refers to the 10^-6^ and the last m there refers to the fact that it's a mass ratio question yes student why is it kilograms of pollutant professor ron smith well because i've got the kilograms here but it's kilograms of pollutant divided by the kilograms of air into which it's been mixed student so they don't cancel out professor ron smith they could that's what i mentioned you could cancel that out i wouldn't mind it at all if you did but i sometimes like to keep it there just to remind myself of what that definition is either way would be fine it'd be perfectly fine to cancel that out normally concentration is considered to be a quantity that has no units but sometimes i like to keep it there just as a reminder yeah student why are the tens raised to the fourth power oh it s meters ok professor ron smith where are you looking student the concentration calculation professor ron smith yeah well that's right so this was 10 kilometers and a kilometer is a 1 000 meters so the 10 times the 3 gives 4 10^4^ meters yeah student what is l~1~ and l~2~ again professor ron smith the horizontal dimensions of the valley student oh so the area professor ron smith well the product is the area of the valley but the l~1~ is the dimension in one direction l~2~ is the dimension in the other direction if you want to know the base area of the valley that's l~1~ times l~2~ other questions yes student where did you get 10^3^ professor ron smith 10^3^ student it s the mass of the air below the inversion professor ron smith well the mass of the air below the inversion is what's in the denominator here it's the density of the air times the volume of the air and the volume was given by that product which you see written out here yeah it's good to get this one really clear because the next one is even tougher so any other questions on this one ok chapter 2 mixing in the atmosphere unconfined mixing 00 07 22 so now we move to case two which is unconfined mixing we don't have this predetermined valley in a nice inversion in which we know things are going to be trapped we know how much pollutant we're putting in i'm going to use the same value as i did here but we don't know into what volume will it be mixed but we're going to assume that there's a certain amount of turbulence in this atmosphere the air is kind of mixing and spinning and moving around a little bit and we're going to define something called the dispersion coefficient which will help us decide how fast that added material will diffuse or will disperse into the atmosphere i'll call it capital k and it has units of meters squared per second and you can estimate a magnitude for that quantity in the following way you can take a typical turbulent velocity let's say there are eddies in this room that are turning over and that air speed has a certain value let's say one meter per second and a typical eddy size maybe the eddies are filling the space between the floor and the ceiling that's about four meters so if that were the case if the typical speed were one meter per second and the eddy size were four meters that would give a dispersion coefficient of four meters squared per second it's simply that product see that'll give you the right units that has meters per second this has meters and so that's going to give meters squared per second when you take that product so this is sometimes very difficult to determine what that dispersion coefficient is going to be for a particular atmospheric application but you can get a rough estimate if you can estimate the size of the eddies and the speed at which those eddies are turning over in this turbulent atmosphere let's say somehow we know what that is then how fast will that mix things into the atmosphere if i have a point source sitting on the ground one direction is as good as any other direction it's going to mix to the left to the right and up equally fast so it's going to produce a kind of hemisphere of pollutant a half sphere that's growing in time as that material diffuses outward and upward and the radius of that hemisphere is given by this formula the square root of the dispersion coefficient times time so the longer you wait the larger that hemisphere will be and of course the more dilute will be the pollutant because you've put a fixed amount of pollutant in unless you're continuing to add it i'm assuming the problem i'm going to work out here you put in just a fixed amount of pollutant and then gradually you watch it dilute itself as it mixes into a larger and larger part of the atmosphere so what does that say it goes as a square root of time that function the square root function increases rapidly at first and then more slowly later on and that is the nature of turbulent dispersion rapidly at first and then more slowly later in time and you may have had that experience if you burn something in the kitchen and you're right there you smell it very quickly a couple of meters away it takes a lot longer to get there and even further away even longer but not linearly it actually gets slower and slower and slower the advance of that burned smell moves slower and slower as time progresses so rapidly at first and then more slowly later on describes how things disperse away from their source so let's carry out this example then let's say the dispersion coefficient on this day is a 100 meters squared per second and that the time we're going to wait after the pollutant was suddenly put in is 10 minutes well that's 600 seconds so the first thing is to compute the radius of that hemisphere that contains the pollutant it's the square root of 100 times 600 and that's about 245 meters by the way check the units on this is this going to give you a length how can that be well if i multiply this times the time the seconds are going to cancel out i'm going to have meters squared inside the square root taking the square root that gives me units of meters and that's just what i need to be physically consistent with this quantity r which is the radius of the hemisphere so these units work out nicely so the radius of that's going to be 245 meters we want to know the volume or the mass of the air into which the pollutant has spread so i've written here the formula for the air mass it's the density of the air ρ times the volume of half of a sphere you may recall the formula for the volume of a sphere is 4/3πr^3^ well i've taken half of that because this is a hemisphere it's half of a sphere so it's 2/3πr^3^ and i put the density in front so i get the mass of the air and it's 3 7x10^7^ kilograms so what have i done i'm going to use the same source here i've mixed in 40x10^3^ kilograms of pollutant into 3 7x10^7^ kilograms of air so the concentration is given by that ratio and it's 1 1x10^-3^ again you could cancel that out or you could say kilograms per kilogram kilogram of pollutant per kilogram of air question yes student so you don't know the radius of the hemisphere unless you know the dispersion coefficient and the time which professor ron smith that's correct it's right so unlike the valley case where we kind of knew from the initial dimensions of the system how big or how much the dilution will be here we have to estimate it based on the dispersion coefficient and the time that's left obviously for longer times that's going to continue to grow and this concentration is going to get less and less and less we haven't removed any pollutant but we've diluted it into a larger and larger amount of air yes student and so the air density is not affected by the pollutant professor ron smith no i'm assuming that this is a small amount of pollutant relative to the air and so no it doesn't change the air density it just mixes in with the air yeah was there another question yes student so this only tells you overall concentration rather than concentration within the different smaller hemispheres it could go to professor ron smith yeah so that's a very good question the question is this only tells you what's going on generally within that sphere it doesn't give you details of what's inside the sphere and of course the model that i've described here is not precisely true if i were to plot concentration across this distance it would be very small outside it would begin to rise smoothly probably would be at maximum somewhere in the middle and then decrease again whereas what i've indicated to you which is a little bit off is if there would be zero outside and uniform concentration inside and then zero again outside and that's not exactly true so your vision of it is actually more accurate than mine it'd be more of a continuous distribution large closer to the source smaller further away but this is an easy-to-compute estimate of what those concentrations would be you would not have a sharp boundary here with this concentration inside and zero outside it wouldn't be like that there'd be more of a gradual transition so this is kind of an approximation to the real condition that's an excellent question other questions on this so there would be our concentration after time 600 seconds you could redo the computation for a later time and you'd get a larger value in the denominator and therefore a smaller value of concentration that's the way dilution works anything else on this ok chapter 3 mixing in the atmosphere unconfined mixing with wind now we're going to add another element of complexity here for case three we're going to add a wind so there's a wind blowing in this system so it's unconfined no valley walls but now there's a wind blowing so i've drawn some little cartoons here there is the source maybe it s a what i'm envisioning here is not just an instantaneous release of pollutant like i was in case one and case two but here i'm envisioning a steady state source of pollution like a power plant that's putting out a certain amount of smoke from the stack per unit time continuously if i had a side view of that and the wind was blowing from left to right i would find that pollutant would be confined in a kind of we call this a plume a plume of pollutant moving downstream getting deeper the further it goes downstream due to the turbulent mixing if i had a top-view of that same situation here's the top-view there's the power plant there's the source the wind is from left to right now we see that plume is spreading in the horizontal dimensions as well again by turbulent mixing and dispersion and if i was to slice this here or here and look at it along the direction of the wind at any particular distance downstream x it would look like half a circle and the radius of that circle will be larger the further downwind that i go because dispersion is enlarging that plume the further we get from the source so how are we going to work this one out again it's just a matter of computing dilution but now this is a steady-state pollution and we're going to have to take into account the effect of wind moving that material downwind so i wanted to define a transit time the time it takes the air to go from the pollutant source to whatever x location we're interested in maybe your house is five kilometers downwind of the power plant well then x is going to be five kilometers and the time it takes the air to get from the power plant to your house is going to be x divided by the wind speed wind speed is capital u in this case notice that'll have the right units distance over a distance per time that's going to work out to have units of time the radius of this plume is given by the same formula we had earlier except now it's this transit time we put in to that formula it's a steady-state situation so it's not changing in time but yet there is this transit time that plays the role of time in the original problem so i'll put in x over t into this formula and i get for this quantity r that you see in each of these three diagrams question yes student what is u professor ron smith u is the wind speed typically in meters per second now by the way the cross-sectional area of this plume if i were to slice across like this it is half a circle and you know the area of the circle is πr^2^ and so the plume cross-sectional area is πr^2^/2 because it's half a circle now here comes probably the trickiest part of the derivation i'm going to assume that i know the source strength and that's how much pollutant is being added to the air per unit time by the power plant that might have units for example of kilograms per second kilograms of smoke let's say being added to the atmosphere every second well in a steady state the amount of pollutant being added at the source must be the same amount that's being carried away by the wind and so by equating those two i can derive a formula for the concentration so this is the key step i'm going to equate the rate at which pollutant's being added to the rate at which it's being carried away by the wind so on the left-hand side is a rate which it s being added this is the rate at which it's being carried away by the wind let me go through this right-hand side that's the air density that's wind speed that's the cross-sectional area of the plume and so that product by itself those three things together is the amount of air per unit time passing away within the plume being carried downwind by the wind and i just have to multiply that times the concentration to convert that from an air mass flux to a pollutant air mass flux so then solving this formula for concentration i get 2 times the source i've plugged this in there as well 2 times the source divided by the density of the air divided by π times k times x and you're going to want to leave an inch or two in your notes to check the units on this as well for example the units on the concentration we expect if previous calculations are right it'll be either kilograms per kilogram if you prefer or it'll have no units at all and so all the units over here should cancel out and leave an inch or two of your notes to deal with that one very interesting thing is that the velocity of the wind canceled out how did that happen i had it here because the rate at which material is being blown downwind is going to be proportional to the wind speed but you see the radius here well the area depends on r and r depends on u underneath so when you square the radius you get a u underneath which cancels that out so the width of the plume will change with the wind speed but not the concentration within the plume and when you do you're going to do a couple of examples like this in your next problem set when you're doing that you might spend a few minutes puzzling over what was the role of the wind speed the wind speed is very important in this problem but in that particular formula it canceled out and so you should try to resolve that little dilemma how if the wind speed is important how did it cancel out in that particular formula so think a bit about how that would work any questions on this yes student what is a professor ron smith a is the is this thing the cross-sectional area of the plume πr^2^/2 yes student what is the x in the equation over there professor ron smith x is the distance between the source of the pollutant and the location of interest your house or the school yard where the kids are playing or whatever it is that you're interested in finding out what the concentration is it's the distance away from the pollutant source now obviously if the wind is from the west and you're living down here somewhere that plume is not going to hit you at all so this calculation is irrelevant for you so the wind direction comes into this in a very important way also i haven't mentioned that up until now but it's probably quite obvious that the wind direction is a key player in this it's only if the wind is blowing generally in the direction from the source to your location that this calculation becomes relevant yeah student does the plume get wider as you go farther away from it so if you live south of it far enough away professor ron smith that's true that's what i've sketched this is a top view it is getting wider fast at first and then slower but it never stops widening it keeps getting wider and wider and wider the further you are downwind so that's true if you lived a great distance downwind but not in the exactly in the wind direction you might still get the pollutant because the pollution will widen the plume so keep track of that when you do these calculations yes student what does source represent in that final equation professor ron smith source would be the rate at which pollutant is being added to the atmosphere at the power plant let s say it could be in units of kilograms per second but if it's particles it could be the number of particles per second that's being added and then your concentration would have to be in the appropriate by the way that's the curve ball i've given you the problem set i think i gave you a problem in which the source was quoted as a number of particles per second and so the concentration then was in units of particles per cubic meter rather than kilograms per cubic meter so just be wary you have to have consistent units when you do this chapter 4 lapse rate 00 27 10 ok now we're going to leave that there and move on to another aspect of mixing which is very important also and that's the role of the temperature lapse rate so i called this section lapse rate and buoyancy effects first of all i want to define what i mean by the lapse rate lapse rate is the rate of change of temperature with height if you launch a balloon and get that data back you can measure the values of temperature with height and you can define the lapse rate it has units typically of degrees celsius per meter or perhaps you would want to use degrees celsius per kilometer it's basically how fast is the temperature change in the atmosphere as you go up and down typically in the troposphere you remember it gets colder as you go up and an average value i'm using lower gamma γ for this typical lapse rate for the troposphere is about 6 5 degrees celsius per kilometer on average every kilometer you go up it cools about 6 5 degrees but don't take that too literally that's just an average sometimes it's very different than that sometimes it's even positive for example in an inversion remember how i defined an inversion an inversion was a layer where the temperature increases with height well that would mean a positive lapse rate instead of a negative one so for some layers and then in the stratosphere remember you have a positive lapse rate the temperature gets warmer as you go up the other really important quantity is a more of a theoretical one but it's equally important it's the adiabatic lapse rate this is the lapse rate that a parcel of air experiences when it rises why would the temperature of an air parcel change when it rises well it's pretty it s fairly straightforward when you take an air parcel of a certain volume and lift it you know the pressure decreases as you go up so when you lift a parcel up it's going to expand a little bit you lift it further it's going to expand still more and when air expands it does work on its environment by pressing out and expanding it decreases the amount of energy stored in the parcel because it's done work on the environment and its temperature drops it's called adiabatic expansion or adiabatic cooling the word adiabatic here means without adding or subtracting heat and you may wonder how can i change the temperature without adding heat the point is i'm changing the temperature by having that parcel do work on its environment not by adding heat from some energy source it's purely a mechanical process of expanding the air and watching it cool because of that adiabatic expansion that's quite a powerful effect as you'll see in just a moment so the adiabatic lapse rate is defined as a rate of cooling as an air parcel rises it is a reversible phenomenon so if a parcel sinks back down in the atmosphere it will compress and its temperature will increase at the same rate i'll use capital gamma γ for this quantity adiabatic lapse rate it can be computed as a ratio of the acceleration of gravity to the heat capacity of the air if this were a course on thermodynamics i would derive that for you for the earth and our atmosphere made of air the value is about -9 8x10^-3^ degrees celsius per meter or expressing that in kilometers it's about -9 8 degrees celsius per kilometer question student what's the denominator again professor ron smith the heat capacity of constant pressure for air you could look it up in a table of physical constants you can google it its value is about a 1 004 i believe in si units so i have to confess i'm a little bit sloppy that number is so close to 10 that i very often round it off to 10 when i'm doing quick calculations and i've done that here in my little example let's say i've got air at sea level that's at 10 degrees celsius and i move it up in the atmosphere three kilometers 3 000 meters what temperature will it be at when it reaches that higher elevation well if i round that off to 10 it's cooling 10 degrees for every kilometer that i lift it so it's going to cool by 30 degrees celsius approximately please i would ask you not to do that rounding in your problem sets let it be 9 8 not 10 but for the purposes of illustration it's going to cool by approximately 30 degrees celsius it starts at 10 so it's going to be -20 celsius when it gets to 3 kilometers you can do that in kelvins as well it will work out the same way if it starts at let's see if it's 10 degrees celsius that's going to be 283 kelvins and subtract 30 from that it's going to be 253 kelvins when it gets up there so you might want to put both the celsius and the kelvins in your notes to be sure you're clear on that question student so that first one there is it s shown as expanded in that diagram professor ron smith that's right i've drawn it that way to remind you that the reason it's cooled is because it has expanded it moved into a region where the pressure was less and therefore it naturally expanded because of that lowered pressure question student so it doesn't matter the size of the air parcel professor ron smith no so it's so simple it doesn't matter the size of the parcel it's just that elevation difference is all that matters that tells you how much on a relative basis it has expanded and therefore how many degrees celsius it has cooled now remember i said this is reversible if i take that parcel and move it back down it'll compress back down to its original volume and it'll return to its original temperature so it's a reversible process student are you assuming the parcel was on the ground professor ron smith the question is whether we're assuming it was on the ground no not necessarily this would happen i could start at any elevation and move it to any other elevation so this is independent of where the ground was i just happened to give you an example with the ground just a three kilometer lifting no matter where you started would give you an approximate 330 degrees celsius cooling questions on that ok chapter 5 buoyancy effects of rising and descending air parcels now we can begin to do some calculations then of what happens to air as you move it up and down in the atmosphere using these two concepts the measured lapse rate and the adiabatic lapse rate so normally in the textbooks you'll see diagrams like this where the temperatures have been put on the x-axis altitude's been put on the y-axis and some reference lines are drawn on here where the slope given by capital gamma γ and then i've drawn in a black curve which represents the actual lapse rate on the day under consideration let's say we've launched a balloon measured temperature as a function of height and i've plotted that up as that black line now the question is what's going to happen to an air parcel as it's moved upwards or downwards in this kind of a situation if i take an air parcel from this elevation and lift it it's going to cool it's going to cool moving along the dashed blue curves because that's the adiabatic lapse rate so this parcel when i take it out of its environment and lift it a little ways it's going to move along like this to its new elevation its new temperature is going to be there and the temperature of its new environment is going to be there here's the tricky part of this argument when you take an air parcel and lift it it's cooling at one rate its environment is changing at a different rate and we're interested in knowing after we lift it a certain amount what is its temperature relative to the environment it's new the air that it's now next to in this case the parcel went to that temperature it moved into cooler air above but that wasn't such a great effect and actually the parcel is now colder than its new environment environment cooled the parcel cooled the parcel cooled more so the parcel is now cold relative to its new environment what's going to happen to that parcel it's going to sink because it's more dense than its environment so i lifted it up there it looks around and says oh my lord i am denser than everything up here back down i go i don't belong here in this crowd i've got to go back i'm negatively buoyant i'm heavy i'm going to sink back you can repeat it you could push that parcel down in the atmosphere it'll move to here there's a new temperature there is a new temperature of its environment it got warmer as it went down the environment got warmer too but it got warmer faster therefore it's warmer than its new environment it's now buoyant it's going to want to bob back up to its original condition this is called a stable atmosphere this term is very important this is called a stable atmosphere because a parcel that is lifted upwards wants to sink back down a parcel that's pushed down wants to bob back up and the atmosphere is usually in this state but not always i want to look at this second example here which is again temperature plotted versus altitude the same reference lines have been drawn on here for capital gamma but i put a different actual lapse rate on that curve it's a lapse rate where the temperature increases with height this is an example of an inversion if i take a parcel from here and lift it it gets colder i'm going to take it from that elevation up to that elevation there s the parcel temperature it's actually been moving into warmer air however so the new environment is there so this is an extreme example of stability this is a very stable environment where the parcel gets colder as you go up the environment gets warmer and so you develop these restoring forces this tendency for the parcel to want to quickly remove go back to where it was are amplified in this case because of the inversion that's the reason why air cannot mix effectively through an inversion because the air parcels want to cool as they rise and yet there's warmer air aloft the two things add to each other making it virtually impossible for air parcels to mix upwards or downwards for that matter the air tends to lay in stable layers stratified stable layers with very little turbulent mixing in a situation like this now the situation that i didn't do and you can fill in your notes do one last case where now tilt this curve over so it's flatter than the reference curves leave some space in your notes for this take that observed temperature the black line rotate it over until it's more horizontal than the blue reference lines and then repeat the argument what you're going to find there is it if you look to parcel it suddenly becomes buoyant relative to its environment and it'll continue to rise that's called an unstable atmosphere same thing would happen if you pushed it down it would become negatively buoyant and it would then drop further another illustration that it's an unstable atmosphere so this sort of thing will have a big impact on how materials mix around in the atmosphere and as we will see next time it also has a big impact on how clouds develop next week we're going to get into the issue of water vapor in the atmosphere how clouds form and then by wednesday or so how precipitation forms in the atmosphere and i think we'll call it quits today but that will be the subject for next week
