Brain
This is an odd and unnatural
view
Maybe you don’t believe it
Maybe you believe in dualism

Dualism
Descartes
(1596-1650)
Animals as reflex
machines, robots
We also have material
bodies
But our minds are
immaterial and nonphyscial

3

Dualism
Argument 1:
The creativity and
spontaneity of
human action

Dualism
Argument 2:
“I think
Therefore I am.”

4

Dualism
“

Dualism seems right
1. Language
“my arm”, “my heart”, “my body”,
“my brain”

5

Dualism seems right
2. Personal identity
Same person after radical bodily
changes

6

Dualism seems right
2. Personal identity -- Many people, one
body
Synopsis: Slapstick,
fantastical farce about an
eccentric millionairess whose
soul inhabits her male
lawyer’s body

7

Dualism seems right
3. The survival of the self after the
destruction of the body

Current view:
Dualism is wrong
Mind = Brain
1. Problems with dualism
2. We know have a better understanding
of what physical things can do
(computers & robots)
3. Strong evidence for the role of the
brain

How does the brain work?


Neurons
•
•
•
•

About 1,000,000,000,000
Sensory neurons, motor neurons, interneurons
All-or-nothing
Intensity: expressed through number of neurons
firing & frequency of firing

9

Neurons
• Communication over synapses; axons release
neurotransmitters
-- excitatory
-- inhibitory
• Drugs: agonists vs. antagonists
-- curare
-- alcohol
-- amphetamines
-- Prozac
-- L-DOPA

Is the brain wired up like a
personal computer?
NO -- because it is:
-- highly resistant to damage
-- extremely fast
… Unlike most human-designed
computers, the brain works through
massively parallel processing

10

What do different parts of the
brain do?
• You don’t need your brain for everything …
-- sucking in newborns
-- limb flexion in withdrawal from pain
-- erection of the penis
-- vomiting

Some subcortical structures
Medualla:certain reflexes,
heartbeat, breathing
Cerebeullum: complicated
skilled motor
movements
Hypothalamus: hunger,
thirst, sleep

11

Less than 1/4 of the human
cortex contains projection areas - the rest is involved with
language, reasoning, moral
thought, etc.

Some very bad things that
could happen to you and your
brain
• Apraxia
• Agnosia
-- visual agnosia
-- prosopagnosia

• Sensory neglect
• Aphasia
• Acquired psychopathy

12

How many minds do you

have?


Brain has 2 Hemispheres
• Left & Right sides are
separate
• Corpus Callosum :
major pathway
between hemispheres
• Some functions are
‘lateralized’
– language on left
– math, music on right

• Lateralization is never
100%

Right
Hemisphere

Corpus Callosum

Left
Hemisphere

13

Sensory Information sent to
opposite hemisphere
Left visual Right visual
field
field

• Principle is Contralateral
Organization
• Sensory data crosses over
in pathways leading to the
cortex
• Visual Crossover

Optic
nerves

– left visual field to right hemisphere
– right field to left

• Other senses similar
Left Visual Corpus Right Visual
Cortex Callosum
Cortex

Contralateral Motor Control
• Movements
controlled by motor
area
• Right hemisphere
controls left side of
body
• Left hemisphere
controls right side
• Motor nerves cross
sides in spinal cord

Motor Cortex

Somatosensory Cortex

14

Corpus Callosum
• Major ( but not only)
Medial surface of right hemisphere
pathway between sides
• Connects comparable
structures on each side
• Permits data received on
one side to be
processed in both
hemispheres
• Aids motor coordination Corpus Callosum
of left and right side

A bit of humility, Part I
• Mind as information processor, as computer
• Recognition, language, motor control, logic,
etc.
• But there still remains The Hard Problem of
consciousness
• Subjective experience, “what it’s like”, qualia

15

“How it is that anything so remarkable as a
state of consciousness comes about as a
result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as
unaccountable as the appearance of the
Djin, when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.”
-- Thomas Huxley

A bit of humility, Part II
• Mechanistic conception of mental life
• But what about humanist values?
-- free will and responsibility
-- intrinsic value
-- spiritual value?
• Can they be reconciled?
