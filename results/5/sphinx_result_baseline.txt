most of what we do these days are methods are theories are ideas
some extent by the edges influenced
and so i wanna do is begin this classes bennett aqua cotton development
but talking about his ideas
ah
his idea was that children are active thinkers
they're trying to figure out the world
the often describe him as little science
tom
and incidentally
the noise coming from on this
he he had a very hum
dramatic
and ambitious goal
he didn't start out because he was interesting children
he started up this easy and rest
in a merchants of knowledge and gentle
bomb it was a discipline he described as genetic that this demolished
the origins of knowledge
but a steady development of the individual child
is he was convinced
tom
that this development will tell him but the development of knowledge
generally
it is a very snoopy phrase
that i don't never heard it before it's a great phrase
it's
aunt ha jimmy week a pitch late a lot
and the idea of this what that means it's
how
development of an individual
minutes are repeats development of this
now
it's entirely not true
but as a beautiful phrase
and
yes he was committed to this he was very interesting look
will figure attic
give it up
and i will tell us about the development
of knowledge more generally
so
yes they viewed the trial
as science as a scientists
the develop his understanding these
he must
the floor manager theories of the world
and a good theirs
to sorts of magnets
i say malaysian an accommodation
so a similar asian
would be the act of expanding the range of things
they you respond
bomb
yet his example would be a baby's used to sucking on a breast
mike compass up on on
a bottle or on a rabbit
that's changing
the scope of things
are you respond
accommodation
is
changing how you do it a baby will form the smell differently
depending on what a subpoena
and so these processes
where you take image
it isn't very physical a
but in a more psychological city of a way of looking at the world
you could expanded to an compass new things
us in malaysia
we but also change
your system of knowledge that cell
accommodation
and yet they argue that these two mechanisms of learning
drove the child difference
pages
on monday at this stage theory
which
quite different from the fourteen stage theory
the we've been introduced
so as methods on
work ask what
from the saul problems
and that's the questions
and this is covering said they did them in different ways at different ages
lead
to the merchants
of the stage there
so for b. s. j.
the first page
is the sensory motor
they age
or a sense room over there
mom
for here the trial
it's purely a physical preacher
trial est no wonder standing in any real way
of the external world
oh there's no understanding of the past
no understanding of the future
no stability
no different she asia
ah
the child just touches
and c.'s
but doesn't get reason
and it's true this stage
the trout gradually comes to wire
object permanent
object permanent says the understanding
things exist
when you no longer see them
so those of you in front you're looking at me
it could get a great magic trick by then appeared in back
now i'm despair
that's object permanent
it
if i women are here
and and people said
when illegal
classes over
that was shallow lack of object for months
tom
so adults have object remains pierre she's very interesting claim is
kids don't
ah
for six novels
p. s. a. absurd
you take an object the kid lights
stick around
yeah hide it
put it behind something
it's gone
and he claimed a child we think it's
come on
things don't continue to exist
when i'm not looking at them anymore
arm
and so he noticed figure surprised by peek a boo
and he has his claim was one reason why there's a private be the boo if you go you know vicki
the tickets my
oh
didn't they call you cover your face because
got
he didn't look cool
there is
he's gone
and he really now that's the plan
he and he also discovered a older children
fail
at a task is known as
a not be passed
and peter grey in his psychology textbook refers to it as
changing hiding places
which is probably a better name or
here's idea
you take a nine month old forget him i'm approaches
starting to make sense
of objects
and under permanent
you take an object you put it
here
in that in a cop
would he can see this in the cup
to the kid here to get will reach for
you do it again
reach for
you again reach for that
then what
you take you move it over here
that's a observe gives ribs
still reach for this
it's like they're not smart enough to figure does not there anymore
will
and this was more evidence
that it is brutal understand object
and it is that this thing takes a lot
time
and learning to develop
the next stage is the pre operational stage
mom
the pre operational satan shout starts up grasping the world
only in a physical wait a sense remote away
when a guess a free operational period
pass me to represent the world
tap the world inside your head
comes into being
but
it's limited
and is limited in a couple of shh
he waits
one way which is limited
is that true werner ego center
but we ego send prison
has a at a meeting in common english which means to be selfish
yes demanded more technical way
clay ritual and live at this age literally
can't understand others can see the world different
from them
so one of his demonstrations was
three mountain stats
yes three mountains over there
you put a trial on one side of mountain
gaston to drop
and i got four five two
can do it easily
but then you ask him to drop
as it would appear from the other side
ensure one finds extraordinary difficult
if i'm very difficult to grasp
the world
as another person
might see it
bomb
i'm not there
significant finding the edge a hat
about
this phase of development
concerns was called
conservation
and the notion of conservation this
that is wasted transfer
form
such that
some aspects of them
change
others remain the same
so for instance
calm
it may take a glass of water
a new poured into another black is shallow
paul
it won't change amount of water us
if you take a bunch of pennies and you spread them out you'll get more panicked
kids accorded the edgy don't know that
this is one are real cool demonstrations any of us access
for five year old
a
a sibling or something
do not take one without permission
but if you have access to four five
when do they just up
this is what looks like
i the first one has no sound second ones can be satin wand and
butters chew on
rose objective she asked ticket
which one has more
his sister's sang and shoot matheson
which one has more
that of that
you
so this release
then huh end
this is amazing amazing finding kids will do that and as a robust whining
here's another example
joe
the same
and what's shown up
one signed
so as a full find a
of that stage
suggesting a limitation
and how you deal make sense of the world
the next phase concrete operations from seven to twelve
even saw the conservation
problem
but still
you're limited
capable of acts
so
the mathematical notions of infinity
or logical motions like logical and tail men
our beyond a child is sick
the child
is able to do a lot
tillotson some extent stock in the com the world
and then finally it around age
twelve
now you can get abstract inside the reason
and this is that the edge gideon
theory
in very brief wong
now
yeah ga
shared a lot better
then did freud or skin
bomb
for several weeks
one reason is
these are interesting and also bible claims
about child
so claims that
about failure conservation
in children
at different ages to be easily test that
to mapping tested
and in fact
there's a lot of support group
the edgy had a ridge the radical framework
pulling together all sorts of observations different
wrote many many books and articles and articulate is theory very rich lake
and most of all i think he has a really striking find
before we actually nobody noticed
forty actually nobody noticed that baby's head is
problem
tracking him understanding objects
at the same time however
there are limitations and yet she's theory
some of these limitations if the radical
wow
it's an interesting question as to whether
he really is
planes how what about those from a concrete
to an abstract anchor
or how would he goes from not having object permits
who understanding object permanent
there's metal logical limitation
yet she was really begin to question and answer
one problem with this says
true or not very good will language
and as might lead you to underestimate how much
they now
this is the tickle your problem
the younger you get
calm
method allah g.
is that loomed heavy
in in in in discussion of any signs
and that includes psychology
often
ninety percent of the game is discovering it
clever method
through which to test
your hypothesis
will win koppel with a butt out regarding babies
i'll give you neither example very different domain
come
there is a set of scientists in dress and studying pickle
so when you take all somebody under what circumstances will a lack
i'm where'd you have to take over
can you tickle yourself as the that'd be a sub
and so on
turns a very difficult to study this in a lap
you know that that you've spread mental credit you come and live it
okay i'm the guy just didn't blow up
and it
and in fact
example of oven that logical attempt was done by ken replied the university of pennsylvania
who built the tickle mission
which was is blocks with these two giant hands that one
grant
and i'm in this was a failure because people could not go near the tickle machine or both
but we will discuss
when we have a lecture on laughter
mom
a bit of the tickle sciences
atlantis factual
what a win vincent don't really know
possible that you did a method logic
limitations of the edgy
he systematically
underestimated
what
children
and babies now in effect our present some evidence suggesting that this is the fact
but this is that the case
mom
so
i want a introduce you to the modern science
of infant caught mission
engine called mission has been something studied for very long time
and there's a certain view
this had behind it
a tremendous philosophical and psychological consensus
and at some arise
in this onion headline
and ideas
that that they've users
bomb
that baby's really don't know much about the world
now
the work
so you headline is sat arising
the recent studies which amid talk about
suggested on the contrary
babies might be smarter effect
and
and
to discover the intelligence of babies
we asked ourselves be pretty smart
in developing different techniques
today what baby knows you can't ask you questions babies
calm
you could look at what it does the babies are not very courtney
or skill
c. is clever methods
one clever methodist
to look at their brain waves
taiwan a right died during testing
by the way to villa roads
i'm
tapping
ah
is that their brain waves
one of the few things babies can do is take a sock on the past
he might people
you know how'd you learn anything from that well for instance
you could build machines
that when babies upon a pass of fire
they hear music
or they airline
and then you could look at
how much they sock and a pass of fire
to determine
they like
but
and then liability we know most
of are not we got most of our knowledge
about babies
from studies of their looking at
tom
that's one thing babies can do
can walk
and then i have a brutus picture of of
elizabeth spelled p.
who's the development of psychologists
develop the most research
on looking at baby's looking times
and what you could learn from them
and i had a two ways you could learn from okay
one is preference
so for the suppose you wanna know
for whatever reason
bill babies like the looks of dogs or cats
well
you put a baby down
have a picture of a dog here
true the cat here
and see which one the baby looks at
babies can move their eyes
annette to tell you something
the baby's distinguish pretty faces
from public face
well
put a pretty face here and i we face here
see the baby prefers looked pretty well
ah
you but also to
habitually asian and surprise
and much of the studies on the top of a year
involve the tuition and surprised
a bid to asian is a fancy word for boredom
when you delays
you show a baby something over and over again
now remember from behaviors
the baby will learn
this isn't very interested
then you show the baby something different
if the baby really sees it as different
the baby will want
and you could use that as a measure of what babies find different
francis
suppose you wanna know at the baby can tell green from rat
well you'd show the baby a green patch of green patch of green patch of green pet
they do get fork
then a red patch
if they all look the same to the baby
bomb
the bade witches
continue to nope
the red looks different
the baby will perk up
and this is in fact
one way the case study collar vision
in babies
surprise is related to this
you could show babies
bang
that shouldn't happen
babies are like
babies also think that shouldn't happen
they might well want
and essentially what happens is scientists do magic tricks
to explore this very
bank
and
for some real examples
a lot of this they've been research
gone back
yesterday the question of object for months
asking
is it really true babies don't know
that objects remain that objects
a remain even when the reds
so when a very simple study
fiat
by spelled hereby are from
they be shown
a block of a bar going back and forth
like that
the bar dispose baton for
now
this something you do it it's so obvious you cry don't even know you doing
when you see it display like that we use a mr jabbar
and what that means or something in the middle
they've never seen before
but of course
if you are simple perception or creature
you would just see
that there'd be a bar on top of a bar baht
you would expect anything inability never sighting
so you do then
issue show baby says
in a new show them either b. or c.
every does with adults
you expect the e. c. is almost a joke
and if that baby's respond the same way
babies expected to be an entire
bar
uh not surprising will longer
the broken bar
tom other studies
some of them calm
well there's another study
by renee way arsenal
looking at the same thing in a different way
your show the baby is a six month old
ah
a stage of a block on
then the screen rises and absurd
here's the wall
now
the babies
expect
the block to still be there
they should think of option
should stop this great
on the other hand
it out of sight out of mine
they should expect a sweetie people want
so you bill is to set up a couple of this place
one word of locke heaps
stop
the other one will you take
you take this away the trap door
and a keeps going
and as you see the babies
greens
when was that that doesn't really happen
with a view
you look longer
ah
one final example of an object permanent study
i'm
some of this works been done at at yale and can win slab
where
they look at baby's understanding of edition is a
and a lot of the center of real objects but there's also animated version
so here's an animated example
hi
coach
it won't
a means of babies are surprise
cuomo
they expect
to minus twenty people won
what to minus twenty pulse
to
or three or zero
they look long
kate surprise
and even six month bills
tom are sensitive to use rude amend the facts of
telling us something with her mathematical knowledge
but also telling us something about the dix
things to remain
when they're out of sight
now
this research suggests
that
in his understanding of the physical world is there been very start
but at the same time
not entirely
we know there's certain things babies don't
his example
ah
suppose you show babies this
yeah but
walk there
and if sonny above it
floating in the air
babies find this surprising
even six models find a surprise
in violates gravity
but
six month old aunts
smart enough to know
that a block this
over here
is also surprise
twelve models will think that should fall
polls don't
even twelve uncles
don't find anything weird about this
while house ers
get him out
to understand
that ship a dozen unstable configuration
and should fall over
so although some things are built then
some things develop
in this raises the question
of how do we explain development
had a we explained
when babies come to know things
that he didn't originally now
well one answer is
a neuro match ration
gross of growth of the brain
i'm
most adam most endurance you and you have now in
right now
you had
when you in your mother's years
what happens in development isn't for the most part the growth of new
as for the most part
groaning
getting rid of neurotic
so the neural structures
changed radically
as babies to get rid of excess interrupt
to development
at the same time though
on connections between around
negro like crazy
and they end this this process of cid nap it growth orders
connections across defensive axes
peaks at about two years
finally remember my one nation
where user to get this fag and she told me dinner on to make it more affected
that also happen through development
and
and in fact
it goes for development and even teenagers
are not fully my way
in particular
they're not wholly my limited thinner frontal looks
recall a frontal loads aren't ball and things like
restraint and will power
if calm
and so it could be the problem is the baby's brain doesn't develop yet
another possibility is
this problems within the addition
this is related again that a frontal worlds
and this comes that will to a not be year
so remember
the baby reaches
reaches reaches its moved
reach fall out
i teach reaching the same flex
and it could be that babies don't know anything about that
but another possibility is
once you do something as cannot park
takes a bit of control stop
and there's all sorts of independent evidence
that baby's lap this control part of her brain that control
certain behaviors
tom
this is not acted
i'm there's a very nice illustration
of
in here the tori problems from a simpson's episode
that actually to covers anything you might wanna know
about development of differences
basically may sum up my to develop mammal psychology
that that shot
that the child essentially
i'm
he does a
a day
it's movie oak
all
any keeps going for
there's some evidence that's true
del diamond study this fight
hello kids reach
for a
they look for b.
as if it did
the know it's there but a cat
and will continue this fame
i will that later
finally
and i think it's on all facts
something you gotta war
and this is true
in all sorts of bombings in the social world and that
economic world political world
true as well and physical world
in fact if something's even adults don't know
so on
so here's a study by michael marc watts que of college student
here's the idea
yeah that too
address at the tube out hollow to
and at the top of it too
you throw a ball
so what should the two
and comes out
question is
what happens to it
does it go in the path that a
or does it on the path of the
with the looking around
who votes for a
who votes for b.
here's the weird thing whenever i get is a yale
everybody gets a damn thing right
hi
johns hopkins
good for a envy
i don't get a better demo
but anyway
college students
not here
show systematic alliances
of a incorrect
physical
into a ships
it's west
and if you want me to be with you found people beware lest
wonderful when you all and asked them
you get lot of people saying the curve ring
but there's it's wet
asked somebody
what if you took the two
and you supported water
through it
where would the water
no woody chooses be
everybody knows the water would continue in a straight on
suggested that when you have experienced
that helps you up an absence of experience
you kind of loss
ah
we talked over the physical world
what about the social world what about the world of people
well there's a lot of research
on this as well
baby start up of some social preferences
if you take a newborn babies
it's very hard to do research newborn babies
it is about
consent procedure in everything
so most of this work is done in fact
we're like we're where they have no laws at all
it is russians that women give birth in russia's it years ago just
in the need to experiment on the babies
and it's rabbit
and if the fight one of them
where
yet babies looking
how
yes
versus that's
babies like
one of the case
these on boards
on grissom preferences whoop humans and will by the primaries
favor face
maybe they're awful social laughed
so their natural minutes
tom
andrew melts up
found
if you go to a newborn baby
did you get a finer newborn baby
this is the first thing firstly you should
face right up newborn baby
lawyers
and stick your tongue out
and i'll stop clients
babies more often than not
there comes a back
i'm suggesting some sort of social connection from one person to another
then later on
babies are next
babies
more often than not will copy
they snacks that
now do you see
the nature of these responses this
spring faces
sort of imagery
as a matter of today there's a lot of research going on
asking
help smarter babies
can we see you some of the same methods
calm
to that we've looked at the physical world
and illustrate
one of the studies i'll tell you that is that the idea
bob about recall meyer
and cameron went
and
so we tested was
nine month old son twelve
and we show the movies
so this setting that nursing a movie
we're one care is gonna help a wallet you bubble
and another characters in the kindred all
and then let us see whether they aches
the ball to approach
tom
the one that helped it
the juan
that hundred
so this is what a baby would see this is literally the same movie
in experiment
thing is
for these sort of experiments
there's a lot of control
so something that's a square earn one movie will be tried on another movie
something that's in the often one movie
will be
ah on the bottom in another vote
it is an example movie
but this is what babies with c.

whoa
and it is over already given the question is
it would days
would they be expected when to approach the one that help that
or broke who won
that maynard
and we find is statistic lake
babies look longer when shown a movie word approaches the juan
he entered a versus help
and this is we take this preliminary evidence
that tom
that
they base the have a social interpretation they see this movie as you see this
in terms of helping him in drink
somebody pointed someday that help it
tender
you could then asked this makes a production
that baby should themselves
further creature whose the helper verses
the inter
and to explore this
a graduate student is department highly hamlet
i started a series of studies
with age we shh
a show babies
three dimensional saints
and give them the characters and see which one may reach for
so here's video
because you have this experiment is that
if
how
oh
wow
oh
fuck
hi
a whole
in a
this wrong
a
no
mon
so if
whoa
offs high wall
then the next drone through deities
daddy
different
bigger used
in the baby's given a choice
and on
one thing to know metal logically is
person giving a choice is blind
to this that
and wine there's a technical term meaning
she had no idea what the babies
and a point about this says
to avoid
either intention are an intentional sort of
trying to get answer you
couldn't do that
she didn't know what to read
two years with a baby say how
a host
call
so high
so
me
so
this is yes
that some social understanding
maybe they're from the very start
this evidence is tentative
very controversial
but
now i wanna raise a huge development about
and a puzzle lives
there are some ways in which
babies arts
not just babies were young children
are very clueless
when it comes to people
and so i have a film clip here
two very nice
showing
babies ignorant sorry young troll runs ignorance of other people
i'll show you the studies
and then will briefly discuss
what they mean
before discussing that example wool the more detail
on any any question
what i did question
yes and act
typically i i don't know who those particular day
children
that lady
on those task
three year old son young four year old santa fe all
and around age of four five
sort of that
carry it around age of
for porn a half
kids make the transition
from sick from a failures
the question by the way was when you children
in that video when would it
what would ages short
i will fail past
yes
come on
the
on the question of whether discriminate conditioning
the news with babies to explore
they hat
i i
i don't now does anybody
that it has been
a
that the
tom colleen as we said that it is not as effective as other methods
part of cromwell using on
look awkward condition with babies is
difficult to get and behave in any systematic way
so looking kind measures tend to be more
marcel
any other questions
yes
hi
a
oh i'm a question or why they show the baby that tickets
to rocket you want
as opposed to wrap a el one
i'm
it was and what they were in dress an experiment my bet is
when a company chose a stickers
they had a pretty good sense a wide of which ones
the boys would prefer
you know studies
comp
the question a why
a boy you might prefer one sort a sticker
and you might get a different responsible girl
come up later
when we discussed it and theories
but that was in it the worst
sue me
in the stat
the interrupted
okay
mom
there's a huge today
or what's going on there
and if you listen at the end
to the psychologist some arising
the psychologist had a very good and very cool
we're strong idea
a wall was going on
it was that children need to know more about minds
to children don't know
about
there you can do something with intent to deceive
they don't understand
that somebody could choose
what you chose a malicious way
this is possible
this is one respectable theory
but the alternatives
they have the right knowledge
but they suffer from problems within edition
so consider both studies
first that it wanted this active of dolls
two big issues militias
is actually very difficult
as possible children can about overwhelmed with that
and when asked on
what would the mother think
would a mother would think
dole
the food
respond with who really sold
annette are some hole
ford's are right answer
that makes this task difficult
the second one the second studied
illustrates this issue even more clearly
take the boy to get failing
you get pointing to the rocket ship and mean monkey get taking it away
it's possible
kiki
genuinely didn't know what to do
it wasn't smart enough to understand
that he needed to pointed other one
but it's also possible
that's a homer simpson like
where
when asked to point to what he wants
he just couldn't help
the one he wanted
and at the actual work it takes
the law
bomb was beyond
and in support of the second alternative
bomb
even adults
fine
these tasks
involving wine
and deception
more difficult or worse lower at them
we make more mistakes
then venom
and half that don't involve
wine deception
so i'm raising this not to solve the problem
you read more about it
in the peter gray textbook
and more about it
in the norton readings on develop
but just a raises as an into resting area
the bait
another interesting area but they
is
what a relationship between different sorts of develop
so i started up the ad
and the engine
like freud
believe in general crossed the border
changes
in how children fact
an alternative though
is that they're separate models
this is a view depend caught
developed again by norm county and also by the philosopher of mine
jerry voter
who claim
the whole idea of a child developing
as a single story is mistaken
what you get instead
is your supper
pre wired systems reasoning about the world
bomb
these systems have some built in knowledge
and a half to do some learning
but the bill learning pattern very consistent the system
anders a separate us
the
why should we take this view seriously
well one reason is
that there are develop mental disorders
it seemed to involve damage
the one system
but not to another
and the classic case of this
is the disorder known as office
not this miss something
i've always found it fascinating disorder from any reason
why i entered psychology start up working with troll run
out with foxes
and
it could be taken as a strike a illustration
about the social part of your brain
is this state
from other parts you wear
so a lot of them is the disorder
that's right to a one in a thousand people
mostly boys

and the dominant problems
juror
consist of a lack of social connected ness
problem of language
problems dealing with people
and
more generally
problems what the psychologists simon baron cullen has described
as mine point
in that artistic people show no inheritance deal in the physical world
they show no one pair months on
they don't necessarily show any pyramids on
mathematical skills are spatial skills
but they have a lot of problems with people
now many artistic children
tom have no language
holy shut off from society
but even some of them would learn language
a new managed to get some sort of independent life
nevertheless
will suffer from a severe social inherent
and this could be shown in all sorts of ways
a simple experiment developer simon brown
calling
goes like this
you show this to three in boils
for kenny fair
and you say
this is charlie in a medal
which chocolate will charlie cake
for most children most of you i hope
answers are declare this one
artistic troll a lot the news
drop
how can i know
because they don't instinctively appreciate
bulls interesting desires
can they be up soon
to where they're located
another sort of task
which is that fastened the nine hundred wraps thousands of times
is it
notice the false leak that
in his idea
you show the child following situation
that on a max
maxine puts the ball in the cover

maxine leaves
and a second dollar enters
the second all
takes the ball whether the cover
puts it under the bet
maxine comes back in the question is
we're will massey look for the ball
at this isn't a question about
your understanding about mine
the question of weir is the ball really
is a question about the physical world
everyone to salt
with this question his heart
the right answers
max will back c. will look in the harbor
even though it's not really there
because max
maxine as a false believe
about the world
three year olds find is difficult
two year olds find it difficult
four year olds and five year old
are able to pass this task
normal adults are able to passes
troll ru boxes and have serious problems
and often true people bought isn't
who are otherwise very high functioning
fail was passed
the sale he must be gets on
the beast in a check
hundred of that
any questions
about palm
about artist
yes
good question it isn't
this is
bolt
both experiment designed to tap and appreciation of false bully
the deception won
jews in everything
look at him a course of deception
can you understand the mother might
i think
that hurts
even know it's really
that person
and i did fail
this is a sort of stripped down version
wolf a roll of fancies
task
exactly the same thing
yes
nobody knows
ah but there's a theory
which
war last year questionable will put under broader context
simon barren colon argues
that are certain abilities
the tend to be more sequestered
for males
another abilities that are more sequestered more focus on payment
tom
social abilities
he argues had to be more female
then mail
so the way barren puts it provocative way
is
to be a mac
very mild formal boxes
come
di da is then
that artistic individual suffer from what he calls
tree mail brains
and as such
it stands to reason
be more sample from the male population
female population
that sets interest the issue
that again we return does talk what sex different
we'll look at that will the more detail to see
yes
i'm sorry commit
this is very of optimism
he
isn't interesting question
ah
question is heading you think about the severity of optimism
with regard to develop mental stages
so surprisingly
ought system
can really be thought out
in that way
so it's not like
an adult will boxes in the sites
we are
to you
in some way so that i thought that with lots of isn't like any trial at all
on any normally developing trial at all
so it's not really develop mantle
wow
it's not really development of the ley
in the way it might make sense to think about certain forms retard age
on the other hand
when we think it would have severe artist
we do look at things and how much language
and in that sense
it is related
yes
ah
the majority of people will watch this
it's a good question a question is
palm
one chance assembly will boxes and we'll overcome
they're deficiency
come
all this in the funny disorder meadows a lot of media publication of media presence
to mop and people who work
showcase in the media
tend to be very exceptional
sir is a woman temple rand
who's artistic in
as anybody ever temple grab
i'm she wrote some wonderful book sweaters
very incest not just a person
but she is very unusual
so
a lot that has actually a question how one defines artist
and whether one includes aspirin for syndrome which is a limited to a
a more miles syndrome as a
former boxes
dancer is
but the majority of people boxes
have severe problems
and more mild and at this stage
with this level therapy
will not lead a normal life
there
right
the question is about so called artistic sub wants
so rain man the character played by dustin hoffman
had extraordinary mathematical ability
and some people boxes them
have extraordinary
artistic abilities are mathematical abilities
or a musical abilities
i'm
these are amazing
is an amazing question why the hat
a lot
this is a very small minority
this is a very it's it's fasten it happens at all
the that severe damage
compensated
was a powerful still now norm
i mentioned question i think a better way
but
is actually very rare
most people boxes and do not have an exception with ease
go along
another question
is
if you believe and models there are models
what are their
and so far one reviewing the develop mental beta
top
about two of them
physics and people
an object module in the social macho
but other people have argued
there's a special module in your brain
for dealing with artifacts
that is
things like tables and chairs and carson forks
sunday love argued
there's a model
theology
for dealing with human groups
racism classes and so on
some have even argued
that there's an intuitive biology
common sense biological understanding of the world
that separates
from mom
from your understanding of people and physics
and in fact
the most dominant opponent of the view
is a very own
fry caught up
master morse college
at yale was strongly defended the notion about
to it a
biological
final question just to raise
i've talked in terms of the module repeat
bought
there might also be profound general differences
between troll run out
not just specific to how you think about object
or how you think about people writing it with this writing
a rather more gentle
and one plane
which meant a return to briefly
that's class me talk about languages
that
there's a very very big difference
it's wiener creature
doesn't have a language
and a creature that does
and part in the claim is al learning a language learning to speak
weekend figures the human brain
in such a way
that is really exception
and as no power of all
in any other species
this isn't the interestingly
klein
and up
one will talk about
ah
finally i want to end with an example
from stephen jay gould
bomb
suppose you heat
developed
you hate development of psychology
you hate babies
you rachel run
they're not you
there i believe you don't wanna
you don't wanna study him
you're you're annoyed that we have discussed
fine
but
there are reasons to steady development
even if you're not interested
in
sure
because sometimes development folks
studies in development obey their develop now size
ken and
for
questions
about adults
stephen giggle as a very nice example of this
he asked the question
is a zebra
a black animal wolf whites
or a white animal of blacks whites
now you could look at halsey burrows
all day long never been a figure this out
but if you wanna know the answer
but i do it but to get what it is
it doesn't matter
would you wanted to know it
you could you look at developed
indeed watched andrea logical the element of a zebra
and that's how you learn
that's your question
all and will the nice
quo
mom
this is by
the famous biology is darcy thompson who wrote
the book on growth and form
and it's sort of out
the model of many development psychologist and many evolutionary psychologists
soul and with us
everything is the way this was a got that way
okay i'll see you next week
