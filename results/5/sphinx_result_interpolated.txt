most of what we do these days are methods are theories are ideas
some extent by piagets influenced
and so i wanted does begin this classes bennett aqua cotton development
but talking about his ideas

his idea was that children are active thinkers
it trying to figure of the world
the often describe him as little science
tom
and incidentally
the noise coming from on this
he he added very hum
dramatic
an ambitious goal
even start up because he was interesting children
he start about this easy into rest
in emergence of knowledge and general
tom it was a discipline he described as genetic epistemology
the origins of knowledge
but he study development of the individual child
is he was convinced
tom
that this development will tell but the development of knowledge
generally
is a very snoopy phrase
that i don't never heard it before it's a great phrase
it's
aunt ha jimmy week a pitch late a lot
and idea this what that means it's
how
development of an individual
minutes are repeats development of this
now
it's entirely not true
but as a beautiful phrase
and
piaget was committed to this he was very interesting look
will fit attic
good develop
and i will tell us about the development
of knowledge more general
so
yes a view to trial
as science as a scientists
the develop is understanding these
schemas
the fool manager theories of the world
and a good this
to sorts of mac and
assimilation an accommodation
so assimilation
would be the act of expanding the range of things
the u. response
bomb
piagets example would be a babies used to sucking on a breast
mike compass up on on
a bottle or on a rabbit
that's changing the
the scope of things
are you respond to
accommodation
is
changing how you do it a baby will form the smell differently
pending a what a sucking
and so these processes
where you take him h
it isn't very physical a
but in a more psychological said cuba way of looking at the world
you could expanded to in compass new things
assimilation
we but also change
your system of knowledge that cell
accommodation
and vs they argue that these two mechanisms of learning
drove the child difference
stages
on monday at stage theory
which
quite different from the fourteen stage theory
but we connectedness
so as methods on
work ask question
from the saul problems
and that's questions
and this is covering said they did didn't different ways at different ages
lead
to the merchants
of the stage there
so for vs j.
the first age
is the sensorimotor
stage
order sensorimotor erik
ah i'm
freudian the child
it's purely a physical preacher
child as know understanding in any real way
of the external world
oh there's no understanding of the past
no understanding of the future
no stability
no different g asia
ah
the child just touches
and c.'s
but doesn't get reason
and it's true this stage
the child gradually comes to wire
object permanence
object permanence is the understanding
things exist
when you no longer see them
so those edu in front are looking at me
it could get a great magic trick by then appeared in back
now i'm this there
that's object permanence
a of
if i wynn under here
and and people said
when illegal
classes over
that which will lack of object permanence
tom
so adults have object permanence piagets very interesting claim is
kids don't
on
for six month olds
piaget observed
you taken object the kid lights
stick around
yeah hide it
put it behind something
effect it's gone
and he claimed child we think it's
come on
things don't continued exist
when i'm not looking at them anymore
on
and so he noticed figure surprised by peek a boo
and he as his claim was one reason why that surprise peek a boo if you go in of acute
it of the kid is my
all
big among the clinic of the face because as
got
the peek a book o
there's
he's gone
and he really know that's the plan
the and he also discovered a older children
fail
at a task is known as
a not b task
and peter gray in this psychology textbook refers to it as
changing hiding places
which is probably a better name or
here's idea
you take and i month olds forget deny month olds just
starting to make sense
of objects
and under permanence
you taken object you put it
here
in that in a cop
would he can see this in the cup
to the kid theory get will reach for
you do it again
reach for
you again reach for that
then
you take you move it over here
then to observe gives ribs
still reach for that's
it's like they're not smart enough to figure does not there anymore
a boo
and this was more evidence
that it is brutal understand objects
in the does the differing takes a lot
time
and learning to develop
annette stages a preoperational stage
mom
the preoperational stage a shout start stop grasping the world
only in the physical waves sensorimotor way
when a guess a preoperational period
pass the to represent the world
tap the world inside your head
comes into being
but
it's limited
and is limited in a couple ups
the way it
one way which is limited
izzat schroeder of egocentric
but we egocentrism
has of at a meeting in common english which means to be selfish
yeah g mended more technical way
clay rich won't live that this age literally
can't understand others can see the world different
from them
so one of is demonstrations was
three mountains that's
yes pre mountains over there
you put a trial on one side an amount
gaston to drop
a metaphor five to
can do it easily
but then you ask him to drop
as it would appear from the other side
ensure one finds extraordinary difficult
they find very difficult to grasp
the world
as another person
might see it
bomb
another
significant finding piaget hat
about
this phase of development
concerns was called
conservation
and the notion of conservation this
that is waves to transfer
form
such that
some aspects of them
changed
others remain the same
so for instance
calm
it v take a glass of water
a new poured into another black is shallow
paul
it won't change amount of water you at
if you take a bunch of pennies new spread them out you'll get more panicked
kids accorded the edgy don't know that
this is one are real cool demonstrations any of us access
horrified neural
of
a sibling as a make
do not take one without permission
but if you have access to for five
wynn divisions of
this is what looks like
i the first one has no sound a second ones can be satin want and
butters to a
rose object yes ticket
which one has more
his sister's same ventured matheson
which one has more
that

so this release
then huh and
this is amazing amazing finding kids will do the them as a robust whining
here's another example
though
the same
and what shown up
behind
so as a full find a
of that stage
to guess to limitations
in how you deal make sense of the world
the next phase concrete operations from seven to twelve
even solve the conservation
problem
but still
you're limited
capable of acts
so
the mathematical motions of infinity
or logical motions like logical and tail month
our beyond a child physics
the child tf
is able to do a lot
tillotson some extent start in the concrete world
and then finally it around age
twelve
now you can get abstract and scientific reason
and this is the v entity in
theory
in very pre for
now
yeah ga
shared a lot better
then did freud or skin
bomb
for several weeks
one reason is
these are interesting in falsifiable claims
about child
so claims that
about failure conservation
in children
at different ages to be easily test and
to mapping test the
and in fact
there's a lot of support for the
piaget at a rich theoretical framework
pulling together all sorts of observations different
wrote many many books and articles and articulate is theory very rich lake
and most of all i think it's a really striking findings
before p actually nobody noticed
for p actually nobody noticed it babies had these
problem
tracking him understanding objects
at the same time however
on there are limitations in piagets theory
some of these limitations are theoretical
how
it's an interesting question as to whether
he really it's
planes how what about those from a concrete
to in abstract anchor
or halloween goes from not having object permanence
who understanding object permanence
there's methodological limitations
yeah she was really begin to question and answer
one problem with this is
true or not very good will language
in this might lead you to underestimate how much
they now
this is particularly problem
the younger you get
calm
method allah g
is that loomed heavy
in in in in discussion of any science
and that includes psychology
all than
ninety percent of the game is discovering it
clever method
through which the test
your hypothesis
what wynn koppel with a but that regarding babies
maybe another example very different i'm a
come
there is a set of scientists interacts and studying pickle and
so when you to call somebody under what circumstances will a lack
i'm woody have takeover
can you tickle yourself as adapted vs of
and so on
turns a very difficult study this in a lap
you not that edu experimental credit you come and live it
okay and understood the of
and iv
and in fact
example of other methodological attempt was than by can read like the university of pennsylvania
who built the tickle mission
which was is blocks with these two giant hands that went
ran
and them and this was a failure because people could not go near the tickle machine about
but we will discuss
when we have a lecture on laughter
i'm
a good of the tickle sciences
atlantis factual
what do infants and children really know
possible that diluted a methodological
limitations of the edge a
he systematically
underestimated
what
children
and babies now in effect are present some evidence suggesting that this is the fact
but this is the the case
tom
so
i want a introduce you to the modern science
of infant cognition
invent cognition has been something study for very long time
and there's a certain view
this had behind it
a tremendous philosophical and psychological consensus
and it some arise
in this onion headline
and ideas
that that babies ers
tom
that babies really don't know much about the world
now
the work
to iv headline is sat arise a
the recent studies which amid talk about
suggested on the contrary
babies might be smarter effect
and
and
to discover the intelligence of babies
we asked ourselves be pretty smart
in developing different techniques
study what baby knowledge you can't ask you questions babies
on
you could look at what it does the babies are not very courtney
or skill
c. need years clever methods
one clever method is
hello that there brain waves
taiwan a right died during testing
by the waits development
i'm
tapping
ah
is there brain waves
one of the few things babies can do is take a sock on the past
he might people
you know how do you learn a thing from that well for instance
you could build machines
that one babies upon a pass of fire
they hear me is a
or they hear when
and then you could look at
how much they suffer pass of fire
to determine
they like
but
and then liability we know most
of are not we got most of our knowledge
about babies
from studies of their looking act
tom
that's one thing babies can do
can walk
and then i of it is picture of of
elizabeth spell peek
who's a development psychologist
develop the most research
on looking at babies looking times
and what you could learn from the
and i had there to ways you could learn from looking
one as preference
so for the suppose you wanna know
for whatever reason
do babies like the looks of dogs or cats
well
you to put a baby down
have a picture of a dog here
true the cat here
and see which one a baby looks at
babies can move their eyes
annette to tell you something
do babies distinguish pretty faces
from public face
well
but a pretty face here and i we face here
seated baby prefers looked pretty well
ah
you but also to
habituation and surprise
and much of the study some atop about here
involve habituation surprise
habituation is a fancy word for boredom
when you jill is
you show up baby something over nor for him
now remember from behaviorist
the baby will learn
this isn't very interested
then you show the baby something different
if the baby really sees it as different
the baby will want
and you could use as a measure of what babies find different
francis
suppose you wanna know at the baby can tell green from rat
well you'd show the baby a green patch of green patch of green patch of green pet
they took it for
then a red patch
if they all look the same to the baby
bomb
the bade which is
continue to about
the red looks different
the baby will perk up
and this is in fact
one way they a study collar vision
in babies
surprise is related to this
you could show babies
bang
that shouldn't happen
babies are like
babies also think that shouldn't happen
they might want
and essentially what happens is scientists do magic tricks
to explore this very
bang
and
for some real examples
a lot of this infant research
gone back
yesterday in question of object permanence
asking
is it really thrilled babies don't know
that objects remain that objects
a remain even wondrous
so when very simple study
fiat
by spelled give a are from
baby shown
a block of a boo are going back and forth
like that
the bar dispose baton for
now
this something you do it it's so obvious you by don't even know you doing
when you see it display like that we use so mr jabbar
and what than these or something in the middle
they've never seen before
but of course
if you are simple perception or creature
you would just see
that there'd be a bar on top of a bar bought
you would expect anything inability never striking
so you do then
issue show babies as
in a new show them either b. or c.
every does with adults
you expect peek c. is almost a job
and effect babies respond the same way
babies expect are to be an entire
are
a not surprise smoke longer
the broken bar
tom other studies
some of them palm
well there's another study
by renee way arsenal
looking at the same thing in a different way
years show that baby is a six month old
ah
a stage of a block on
then the screen rises and absurd
years of law
now
the babies
expect
the block to still be there
they should think a block to
should stop this great
on the other hand
it out of sight out of mine
they should expect the sweetie people want
so you village to set up a couple of displaced
one word of locke heaps
stop
the other one week a
you take this away the trap door
and a keeps going
and as you see the babies
greens
when was that that doesn't really happen
with a boo
you look longer
i'm
one final example of an object permanence that a
i'm
is some of this works been done act act yale and can wynn slab
where
they look at babies understanding of editions of
and autism of real objects butters also animated version
so here's an animated example
hi which which

or would
a means babies are surprise
oh
they expect
to minus twenty who people won
it would to minus twenty pulse
to
or three or zero
a look long
kate surprise
and even six month olds
i'm are sensitive to use rude amend the facts of
telling us something with her mathematical knowledge
but also telling us something about the dix
things to remain
when they're out of sight
now
this research suggests
that
in this understanding of the physical world is there from the very start
but the same time
not entirely
we know there's certain things babies don't
his example
i'll
suppose you show babies this
yeah but
walk there
and if sunny above the
floating in the air
babies find this surprising
even six month olds find a surprise
the violates gravity
but
six month old aunts
smart enough to know
that a blocked is
over here
is also surprise
twelve month olds will thinkers should fall
polls don't
even twelve month olds
don't find anything weird about this
while adults ers
created not
to understand
they that ship a dozen unstable configuration
and should fall over
so although some things are built then
something's develop
in this raises the question
of how to we explain development
had a we explain
when babies come to know things
that he didn't originally not
well one answer is
a neural maturation
gross of growth of the brain
i'm
most adam also been errands you and you have now and
right now
you had
when you in your mother's years
what happens in development isn't for the most part the growth of new are
is for the most part
groaning
getting rid of neural
to the neural structures
changed radically
as babies to get rid of excess interrupt
through development
at the same time though
on connections between around
negro like crazy
and they then does this process of cid nap it growth orders
connections across different said axes
peaks at about two years
finally remember my one nation
where user to get this fag and she told me dinner on to make a more effective
that also happen through development
and
and in fact
it goes for development and even teenagers
are not fully my way
in particular
they're not wholly my limited thinner frontal looks
recall a frontal loads learn ball and things like
restraint and will power
tf calm
and so it could be the problem is the babies brain doesn't develop get
another possibility is
this problems with inhibition
this is related began to different the world
in this comes that will to a not b year
so remember
the baby reaches
reaches reaches is moved
rich fall out
achieve reaching the same flex
and it could be that babies don't know anything about objects
but another possibility is
once you do something is can a heart
takes a bit of control stau
and there's all sorts of independent evidence
that babies lack this control partner brain edu control
certain behaviors
tom
issues not active yet
i'm does a very nice illustration
of
in give a tory problems from a simpson's episode
that actions or to covers anything you might wanna know
about development of differences
basically may some of my to develop mammal psychology
that that shot
that the child essentially
i'm
he does a
a a
it's movie o
all
any keeps going for
and is some evidence that's true
del diamond study this find
hello kids reach
for a
they look for b
as if they
the know it's there but he can't
and will continue the same
a little bit later
finally
and i think it's on all facts
something you gotta war
and this is true
in all sorts of domain sin the social world and that
economic world political world
true as well and physical world
in fact are some things even adults don't know
so i'm
so here's a study by michael marc watts q of college student
here's the idea
yeah the to
a transfer at to about hollow to
and at the top of the to
you through a ball
so what through the to
and comes out
question is
what happens to a
does it go in the path that a
or does it on the path of the
with the looking around
who votes for a
who votes for b
here's the weird thing whenever i get izzat yale
everybody gets a damn thing right
i
johns hopkins
good for a and b.
i to get a better demo
but anyway
college students
not here
show systematic bias is
of a incorrect
physical
into which it
it's west
and if you wired into giving if you found people who were less
wonderful when you all and asked them
you get lot of people saying the curve ring
with years of sweat
asked somebody
what if it to the to
and you supported water
through it
where would the water of
nobody chooses b
everybody knows the water would continue in a straight on
suggested that when you have experience
that helps you up an absence of experience
you can of los
ah
we talked about the physical world
what about the social world what about the world of people
well there's a lot of research
on this as well
baby start up of some social preference a
if you take a newborn babies
it's very hard to do research newborn babies
does that to
consent procedure in everything
so most this work is done in fact
we're late word way they have no laws at all
it is russians that women give birth in russia's it years ago just
in any do experiments on babies
and it's reflect
and if of like one of them
where
yet babies looking
act
this
versus that's
babies like
one of the case
these and boards
on grissom preferences with humans and look by the primaries
favor face
babies are awful social act
so their natural minutes
tom
andrew melts up
found
if you go to a newborn baby
maybe get a for the newborn baby
this is the first thing firstly you should
face right up newborn baby
boys
and stick it on the
and all saw finds
babies more often than not
there comes a back
i'm suggesting some sort of social connection from one person to another
then later on
babies are next
babies
more often than not will copy
face next of
now these
the nature these response assist
spring face of
sort a minute pre
as a matter of today there's a lot of research going on
asking
helps smarter babies
can we see you some of the same methods
i'm
to that we've looked at the physical world
and illustrate
one of the studies kelley but is that the idea
of with valerie kuhlmeier
and karen when
and
so we tested was
nine month olds in twelve are
are we show that movies
so reasoning that nursing a movie
we're one characters to help a ball achieve a ball
and another character sunny hinders all
and then let's see whether they aches
the ball to approach
tom
the one that help the
the one
that hundred
so this is what a baby would see this is literally the same movie a
in experiment
thank is
for these sorts of experiments
there's a lot of control
so something that's a squared one movie will be a trying them another movie
something that's in the often one movie
will be
on the bottom and another vote
so this an example movies
but this is what babies with c.

whoa
and it is over already get in the question is
would face
would babies expect the wynn to approach the one that help that
war broke who won
that hinders the
and we find is statistically
babies look longer wynn shown a movie word approach is the one
he entered a versus help
and this is we take this preliminary evidence
that tom
that
big based give a social interpretation they see this movie as you see this
in terms of helping in in drink
somebody pointed someday that help the
tender
you could then ask this makes a production
that baby should themselves
further creature whose the helper versus
the hinderer
and to explore this
a graduate student is department highly hamlet
i started a series of studies
with age we shh
a show babies
three dimensional saints
and give them the characters and see which one a reach for
so here's video
to does he have this experiment is that
tf
how
oh
well
oh
of

a whole
in a
this long

a

so if
i
of how all
then that strode who did reason
that the
different
bigger used
and babies given a choice
and on
one thing to know methodological is
person giving a choice is blind
to this that
and wind years a technical term meaning
she had no idea what the babies
and a point about this is
to avoid
either intention are an intentional sort of
trying to get action
couldn't do that
she didn't know what a right to
so years with a baby say how
case
call
so high
so

so
this is yes
that some social understanding
maybe there from the very start
this evidence is tentative
very controversial
but
now i wanna raise a huge development of
and a puzzle lives
there are some ways in which
babies arts
not just babies were young children
are very cool looks
when it comes to people
and so i have a film clip here
to very nice
showing
babies ignorant star young troll runs ignorance of other people
i'll show you the studies
and then will briefly discuss
what they mean
before discussing that example will the more detail
i'm any any question
what i did question
yes and act
typically i modern helper those particular tf
children
that lady
on those task
three year old son young for your olds and to fail
an around age of four five
to the but
carry it around age of
for porn a half
kids make the transition
from sick from a failures
to question by the way was when you children
in that video when word of
what would age of children
i will fail at
yes
my
the
on the question of whether discriminate conditioning
the news with babies to explore
they have
i at
i don't know does anybody
that it has been

that the
tom koleen action said that it is not as effective as other methods
part of cromwell using on
look awkward conditioning with babies is
difficult to get in behave in any systematic way
so looking kind measures tend to be more
more solve
any other questions
yes


oh i'm the question a why they show the baby that tickets
to rocket you want
as of was a rap a el one
i'm
it was and what they were in dress an experiment my bed is
when a company chose a stickers
they had a pretty good sense a why of which ones
the boys would prefer
you know studies
how
the question a why
a boy you might prefer one sort a sticker
and you might get a different responsible girl
come up later
when we discussed different theories
but that was in it the worst
to me
in this that
the of
okay
tom
there's a huge today
or what's going on there
and if you listen at a and
to the psychologist some arising
the psychologist had a very good very coll
we're strong idea
a wall was going on
it was that children need to know more about minds
to children don't know
about
there you can do something with intent to deceive
they don't understand
that somebody could choose
what you chose a malicious way
this is possible
this is one respectable theory
but the alternatives
they have the right knowledge
but they suffer from problems with inhibition
so considerable studies
first that into wanted receptive of dolls
to big shoes little issues
izzat the very difficult
as possible children can it got overwhelmed with that
and when asked on
what would the mother think
would a mother would think
goal
the food
respond with who really stole of
annette are some hole
ford's are right answer
that makes this task difficult
the second one the second study a
illustrates this issue even more clearly
take the boy to get failing
he get pointing to the rocket ship and mean monkey get taking it away
it's possible
kiki
genuinely didn't know what to do
it wasn't smart enough to understand
baby needed to pointed other one
what is also possible
that's a homer simpson like
where
when asked to point to what he wants
he just couldn't help
the one he wanted
and and action a work it takes
the law i
bomb was beyond
and in support of the second alternative
bomb
even adults
fine
these tasks
involving wine
and deception
more difficult or worse lower at them
we make more mistakes
then venom
then task that don't involve
why conception
so i'm raising this not the solve the problem
you read more about it
in the peter gray textbook
and more about it
in the norton readings on develop
but just a raises as an into resting area
the bait
another interesting area but they
is
what are relationship between different sorts of develop
so i start about the ad
and the and a
like freud
believed in general crossed the border
changes
in how children fact
an alternative though
izzat are separate modules
this is a view depend got
develop again by norm chomsky in also by the philosopher of mine
jerry fodor
who claim
the whole idea of a child developing
as a single story is mistaken
what you get instead
is are separate
pre wired systems for reasoning about the world
bomb
these systems have some built in knowledge
and a half to do some learning
but the bill learning pattern very consistent the system
anders a separate us
the
why should we take this view seriously
will one reason is
that there are develop mental disorders
it seemed to involve damage
to one system
but not to another
and a classic case of this
is the disorder known as autism
and autism is something
i've always found it fascinating disorder for many reason
why i entered psychology start about working with children
out with autism
and
it could be taken as a striking illustration
about the social part of your brain
is distinct
from other party where
so what autism is the disorder
as right to a one in a thousand people
mostly boys

and the dominant problems
juror
consist of a lack of social connectedness
problems of language
problems dealing with people
and
more generally
problems what the psychologist i'm invent cullen has described
as mindblindness
in that artistic people shown no impairment the of the physical world
they show no impairment on
they don't necessarily show any impairment on
mathematical skills are spatial skills
but they have a lot of problems with people
now many artistic children
tom have no language
poorly shut off from society
but even some of them would learn language
a new managed to get some sort of independent life
nevertheless
will suffer from a severe social impairment
and this could be shown in all sorts of ways
a simple experiment development simon brown
o n
goes like this
you show this to three in boils
for can these there
he's a
this is charlie in a metal
which chocolate will charlie take
for most children most of you i help
answers are declare this one
artistic shown walk the news
drop
how can i know
because they don't instinctively appreciate
bulls interesting desires
can they be up to
to where they're looking
another sort of task
which is a task that linden hundred wraps thousands of times
is
notice of false to leave that
in his idea
you show the child following situation
that on a max
maxine puts the ball in the cover

maxine leaves
and a second dollar enters
the second all
takes the ball another the cover
puts it under the that
maxine comes back in the question is
we're will massey look for the ball
at this isn't a question about
you're understanding about minds
the question of we're is the ball really
is a question about the physical world
everyone to salt
with this question his heart
the right answers
max will back z will look in the upper
even though was not really there
because max
maxine as a false believe
about the world
three year olds find is difficult
two year olds findings difficult
four year olds and five year old
are able to pass this task
normal adults are able to passes
troll rube autism have serious problems
and often true people of autism
who are otherwise very high functioning
fail with task
the sale he must begin to
the beast object
hundred of that
any questions
about palm
about autism
yes
good question isn't
this is
world
both experiment designed to tap an appreciation of false poorly
the deception one
jews in everything
look at in the course of deception
can you understand the mother my tf
thank
backwards
even know it's really
that person
and i get failed
this is a sordid stripped down version
wolf a role a fancies
task
exactly the same for
yes
nobody knows
ah but there's a theory
which
war last year question the warp wooden a broader context
simon barren colon argues
that are certain abilities
the tend to be more sequestered
for males
another abilities that are more sequestered more focus on payment
i'll
social abilities
he are used to be more female
then mail
so the way barren puts it provocative way
is
to be a mac
very mild formal boxes
come
di da is than
that artistic individual suffer from what he calls
tree mail brings
and as such
it stands to reason
you more sample from the male population
female population
that sets interest the issue
that again we return does talk what sex different
we'll look at that will that more detail to see
yes
i'm sorry commit
this is very of autism

isn't interesting question
ah
question this had and you think about the severity of autism
with regard to develop mental stages
so surprisingly
autism
can really be thought a
in that way
so it's not like
and that'll of autism the sight of
three or
to you
in some way some and i got that with autism isn't like the trial at all
i'm any normally development child all
so is not really develop mental
got
is not really development of the way
in the way it might make senses think about certain form to return age
on the other hand
when we think it would have severe autism
we do look at the that how much language
and in that sense
it is related
yes
palm
the majority of people of autism
it's a good question question is
palm
one chance in some b will autism we'll overcome
their deficiency
i'm
autism the funny disorder meadows a lot of media publication media presence
to mop and people who work
showcase in the media
and the very exceptional
sir is a woman temple rand
who's artistic and
as anybody ever temple grab
i'm g look some wonderful book sweaters
very in test not just a person
but she's very unusual
so
a lot that has actually a question how one defines artist
and whether one includes ask river syndrome which is a limited set a
a more miles in them as of
form of autism
dancer is
but the majority of people boxes
have severe problems
and more mile an at this stage
with is welfare b
one not lead a normal life
there
right
the question is about so coll lots it sticks of wants
so rain man the character played by dustin hoffman
had extraordinary mathematical ability
and some people autism
have extraordinary
artistic abilities are mathematical abilities
or a musical abilities
i'm
these are amazing
is an amazing question why that
a lot
this is a very small minority
this is a very is is fasten it happens at all
the that severe damage
compensated
was a powerful still now norm
i mentioned question i think of that way
but
is actually very rare
most people boxes and do not have an exception with these
goal
another question
is
if you believe and modules if there are modules
what are that
and so far wynn reviewing the develop mental beta
top
about two of
physics and people
an object module in the social module
but other people have argued
there's a special module in your brain
for dealing with artifacts
said is
things like tables and chairs and carson forks
some be above argued
there's a module
theology
for dealing with human groups
racism classes and so on
some have even argued
that there's and intuitive biology
common sense biological understanding of the world
that's separate
from palm
from your understanding of people and physics
and in fact
the most dominant opponent of the view
is a very own
fry caught up
master morse college
i yale was strongly defended the notion about
to iv
biological
final question just to raise
i've talked in terms that a modular v
but
there might also be profound general differences
between children adults
knowledge is specific to how you think about object
or how you think about people writing but this writing
a rather more general
and one plane
which but a return to briefly
that's class me talk about language is
that
there's a very very big difference
between a creature
doesn't have language
and a creature that does
and parted a claim izzat learning a language learning does v
weekend figures the human brain
in such a way
that is really exception
and as nope are all
in any other species
this isn't the interesting
klein
and up
one will talk about
ah
finally at one end with an example
from stephen jay gould
bomb
suppose you he
development
you hate development of psychology
you hate babies
you hate children
they're not q
there i believe you don't wanna
you don't wanna study and
you're you're annoyed that we have discussed
fine
but
there are reasons to study development
even if you're not interested
in
children
because sometimes development olds
studies in development obey their develop now size
ken and
for
questions
about adults
stephen giggle as a very nice example of this
he asked the question
is a zebra
a black animal what whites
or a white animal of blacks whites
now you could look at adults iv grows
all day long new never been a figure this out
but if you wanna know the answer
act i do but to get what it is
it doesn't matter
would you wanted to know a
you could you look at development
indeed watched andrea logical development of a zebra
and that's how you learn
that's achieve question
all and will the nice
quo
tom
this is by
the famous biology is darcy thompson who wrote
the book on growth and form
and it's sort about
the model of many development psychologist of many evolutionary psychologists
so and with this
everything is the way it is because it got that way
okay i see you next week
