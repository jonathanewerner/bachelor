piagets theory of 
cognitive development 
piaget believed that children are active 
thinkers constantly trying to construct more 
advanced understandings of the world 
little scientists 
these understandings are in the form of 
structures he called schemas 
development of schemas 
schemas are frameworks that develop to help 
organize knowledge 
assimilation process of taking new information 
or a new experience and fitting it into an 
already existing schema 
accommodation process by which existing 
schemas are changed or new schemas are 
created in order to fit new information 
piagets approach 
primary method was to ask children to 
solve problems and to question them 
about the reasoning behind their solutions 
discovered that children think in radically 
different ways than adults 
proposed that development occurs as a 
series of stages differing in how the 
world is understood 
sensorimotor stage 
birth 
information is gained through the 
senses and motor actions 
in this stage child perceives and 
manipulates but does not reason 
object permanence is acquired 
object permanence 
the understanding that objects exist 
independent of ones actions or perceptions of 
them 
before months infants act as if objects 
removed from sight cease to exist 
can be surprised by disappearance reappearance of a face 
peek a boo 
then failure at a not b task 
preoperational stage 
years 
emergence of symbolic thought 
egocentrism 
preoperational stage 
years 
emergence of symbolic thought 
egocentrism 
lack the concept of conservation 
concrete operational stage 
years 
understanding of mental operations 
leading to increasingly logical thought 
less egocentric 
but inability to reason abstractly or 
hypothetically 
formal operational stage 
age adulthood 
abstract and scientific reasoning 
piaget scientific evaluation 
highly positive 
interesting falsifiable claims 
rich theoretical framework 
striking findings 
piaget scientific evaluation 
theoretical does he really explain 
development 
methodological limitations of q a 
factual what do infants and 
children really know 
the modern science of infant 
cognition 
methods for studying infants 
brain waves 
sucking 
looking 
preference 
habituation surprise 
infant understanding of the 
physical world 
the case of object permanence 
much understanding of the 
physical world is there from 
the very start 
but not everything 
how do we explain 
development 
neural maturation 
problems with inhibition 
a not b 
the accumulation of 
knowledge 
infant understanding of the 
social world 
social baby 
social prediction by babies 
with valerie kuhlmeier karen 
wynn 
month olds month olds 
shown movies in which one character helps a ball achieve a 
goal and another character hinders the ball 
then shown test movies in which the ball interacts with these 
characters in an entirely different situation 
do babies expect the ball to behave differently with regard to 
the helper vs the hinderer 
some understanding of the 
social world may be there 
from the very start 
but there are also some striking 
limitations 
open question i 
why do children do so poorly at these social 
tasks 
they need to learn more about minds 
vs 
they have the right knowledge but suffer from 
problems with inhibition and action 
open question ii 
what is the relationship between different sorts 
of development 
general changes in how children think 
freud piaget 
vs 
separate modules 
chomsky fodor 
a modular conception of 
development 
separate partially pre wired systems 
for reasoning about the physical and 
social world 
innate knowledge 
constrained development 
a damaged module autism 
about in 
mostly boys 
lack of social connectedness 
language impairment 
treat people as objects 
mindblindness 
open question iii 
if there are modules what are they 
physics and people but also 
artifacts 
sociology 
biology 
open question iv 
are there any profound general 
differences between the minds of 
children and adults 
effect of language 
why study development 
everything is the way it is 
because it got that way
