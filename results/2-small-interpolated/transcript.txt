but the most articulate and well-known defender of dualism is the philosopher rene descartes and rene descartes explicitly asked a question are humans merely physical machines merely physical things and he answered no he agreed that animals are machines in fact he called them beast machines and said animals nonhuman animals are merely robots but people are different there's a duality of people like animals we possess physical material bodies but unlike animals what we are is not physical we are immaterial souls that possess physical bodies that have physical bodies that reside in physical bodies that connect to physical bodies so this is known as dualism because the claim is for humans at least there are two separate things there's our material bodies and there's our immaterial minds
