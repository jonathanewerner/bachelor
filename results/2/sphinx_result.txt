look at it again if the class proper
bob
the production psychology
it was a discussion about the brain
it if you or i will eat off the class
ah
tonight the yep
that the nobel prize winning
well it just
francis grit
cried guest
the astonishing hypothesis
and astonishing hypothesis
is some riots
like this
as he writes this donahue by potts says that you
your choice in your sorrows your memories you ambitions are sense
why didn't you free will
or in fact no more than the behavior of the past assembly a nerve cells
bob
as who was carole salads like a fraser
you're nothing but a pack of notes
stop
it is fair to describe this as astonished reviews and on and unnatural
and i don't actually expect people to believe that
the smoke one question whether you believe that when this class comes to an end
but i can surprise
if they need you leave it out
most people thought
most people
what deferred
most people
our tulips
fabulous
is a very different options
it's about brittany found
every religion
in most philosophical systems
after orchestrated
it was very explicit in plato
for instance
the most articulate
and well known defender pillows
is a philosopher renee picard
and when a car bomb
explicitly after question
our humans merely physical
the sheets
merely physical frank
the astronaut
he agreed that have a house
army cheats
in fact i call them beast machines
and so that rules not unanimous
or merely robots
but people are different
is it about the people
white animals we possess
your body
but on like animals
what we are
is not physical
we
our immature of souls
possessed
physical bought that
that happens winds
the reside invisible ones
that connects
to physical flights
optimism is due melissa
because the claim is rich human said research to separate fact
there's a material bodies
and as a artie material mind
that a car rachel arguments
for jewels
the one argument
bob
involved observations with human action
today cognitive in are fairly sophisticated hi
it is time to have robots
these were not what robots of course to robots
our
why am i drops
today carbon walk round to french will bart
and a friend who will guards were set up
but vicinity century tuesday one
the eddie's characters
that would operate according to water
and so he stepped on a certain level
the source bigfoot jumped up sore
he stepped somewhere else
the the duty would cover shelf up
behind some bushes
and it was set
white
these
machines respond in certain way
a certain actions
so machines
can't asserted that that is
our bodies worked out wait till he tapped somebody on any your bible
well maybe that's all we are
but they carts a day can be
because surfing is a humans do
and no machine could ever get humans
are not limited
to reflects affection grabbing humans are capable of
coordinated created
boxing
fox eats
we can use language for us
as sometimes by use of language a candy reflects of some business
how are you as if
i'm fine how are you
but sometimes
ah
i guess a way to study how retreat and good
that is shows
in machines a carpet
but incapable of that sort of choice
hence we are not here
the sheets
the second argument
as of course quite famous
and this was and that it is
he came to use in a method of doubt
so he started asking so the question
what can i be juror up
annie so well
i believe there's a thought
but honestly i can't be sure it's about
i believe i live in a rich country
but maybe i didn't fool
yes i i believe i have friends and family
but navy
i am being tracked
the evil demon friends
as trick
asked to look at me into thinking i had experiences
ah
there are real enforced mater
version of this is the matrix
the idea to matrix explicitly built upon partition
the cards for a seven evil demon
maybe everything your melts
very inside
is not real
the rafters of product
some other perhaps what
they carts in which it could jody us plot is like
that he noticed that madman
sometimes we get it
the lives
great leader different sizes and shapes and a really are
oh i know about grace
i mean crazy people
don't think they're pretty so that gothic embraces and have operas
no one no picard said
i'm not really great
but there is one thing they caught concluded its did not go
and that's just did not go
eighty's and sell think
that oneself or feud
as a fake argues the method of bell
the safe
there's something really different
but having a lot
that's always insert
from having a minute
any uses are given as a way to support clueless
as it
a way to support the idea
bodies and minds
are separate
and so concluded
i knew that i was the substance of lessons are nature which is a thing
and at worst existence
there's no need
of any place
nor does it and any better real thing
that's save a soul by which i am
what i am
isn't higher biggest thing
from baht
yeah
i said before it is as common sense no one illustrate
common sense nature of this
and if you wait
one thing is
our jewel isn't isn't nash known language
so we have a certain
motive talking about things and we all
things are close to us
why are my heart my child my car
but we also extend that trip
my body my brain
talk about ollie or break
as if for some have suffered from
our goal isn't shows up into which you spoke persuaded
what this means is
that
common sense tells us
that somebody can be the same person even other body under those rattle
found changes
bob the best examples of this
our fictional
so we have no wonder no problem
understanding the movie
we're somebody go to sleep
as a teenager
in wakes up
garner
small person
crap
and only was it
nobody says all of that document and i believe that there are true
same time
no let him know have no teenager note however pieces and we can safely compete
rather we follow
follow
follow the story
we can also followed stories
which involved worker found transformation
as when a man dies and is reborn
while
now
you might have different views are radical renders the what'd
so with every inclination believe it
but we can imagine it would imagine a person
dying and we averted another body
this is not hollywood invention
when the great short stories of last century begins
like hot spot
as greater sense awoke one morning from uneasy to defects of france for been despair
and again how to end
invites us to imagine waking up
into a barring a o'clock
and we can
this is awesome mater
hundreds of years for the birth of christ
homer
describe the fate of the companions
a vote is yes
who were transformed by a witch
indicates
that has not quite right
she didn't terminated which is something worse
she stopped them in the bodies of hate
that voice in brussels embodied
one of their mind reader
so they were candor weeping
and we are invited to imagine a fate that began firing herself in the bodies
of other creatures
any given that genesis is because you were mentioning white you are
this effort
from the body
the reside
we allow for the notion of many people cannot buy one body
this is a main stay of some slap stick humor including classic
movie albeit
she marble it i recommend it
but many people
the thea sort of thing really acts
one analysis of multiple personality disorder
he's a good many people inside a single body
fighting it out for control
now we will discuss multiple personality or
for c. n. a business that turns up
things are a good deal more complicated
but still my point is about
how really is how we think about that
common sense tells us
you could have more than one percent
inside a single line
it shows up in a different context
involving exercised
we're maple leaves systems awhile
for the idea that people's behavior
to a very evil or rational behavior could lead to something else
has taken over
their bodies
finally
bob
most people around the world
or religions and most people in most countries at most times
believe it
that people can survive obstruction of their bodies
among them cultures differ
according to the fate
of the bottom
some cultures have white boy detectors i betrayed us all
some cultures have you going to head them
we're descending to hell
others have you occupy another body
um
still others have you occupied awards
your world
but with a share is the idea would you walk
the seth were pulled from his physical thing you carry around
and a physical thing
op
they you carry around
i can be destroyed
when you live long
these years are particularly comment
in united states
in one survey
then in chicago few years ago
people were es or religion
and there were asked what would happen to them when they die
most people is that we're christians
and about ninety six percent efficient set
when i die what happened
some of the sample was jewish
at judaism
is actually relation with less
players
for you but after what
still
most of the subjects which ended by themselves do it
said one day di to what happened
pop some of this apple denied having any religion at all
they have no roach
aw
still
when these people rascal would happen when they would die
most of them answered unlimited heaven
oh
so
don't listen isn't actually eat a lot rests
but at that point seven
the scientific consensus now residual listeners rock
there was no view
several whole were separate
from your body
it's a killer
there's no use admirable
from your brain
to put at the white cotton that scientists in psychologist neuro scientists like that
what
bob
the mind is what the brain does
for the mind reflect the word kings of the brain
like occupation
working
computer
now why would you hold
no rages
why would he reject you will listen favor this alternate
what's your reasons
one reason is
tillotson is always have problems
one thing
supper family and scientific doctor
we wanna know what's curious people
pouch full of our language
what we find attractive or unattractive
what's the basis for mental illness
and you will isn't simply says
it's a lot visible spark the ether
and hence fails to explain
more specifically
to a less like a car
trouble to explain
how does a full body
the next twenty material saul
mr conduit
how did this connection be made after all the carbon full well
there is such an act
eat you your body will be sure commands
if you bang your toasted your child you feel pain
to drink alcohol it affect your resuming
the big only waive his hands
as a half as physical
thing in the world
annette
to immature ill wind
a car
when he was alive
was reasonable enough
concluding
that is a full objects
cannot do certain facts
he was reasonable and grumbling fritz as good
butters no way merely physical walk could ever play game
because enact such a capacity is beyond capacity
but the visible world
and you have to fly
you have to extend exploration
twenty material soul
but now we know
we had it with what scientists call an existence prick
we know
physical objects
and you complicated interesting things
we know for instance
machines can play chess
we know machines to manipulate symbols
we know machines have limited capacity east
to
engage in mathematical logical reasoning
op to recognize things
to do various forms of caucasian
this makes at least
possible
that we are such machines
so what are you can no longer say look
physical thing just can't do that
because we know faithful thing to do a lot
and as always a possibility
they get that humans are visible fangs into together
that humans are brains
why why
there's fry evidence
that the brain is involved
in mental like
somebody will the public dual this view
ah
it said that while we do what we decide what we think what we want
or will have nothing to do with the physical world
would be embarrassed by the fact
but the brain seems to correspond
indeed drifted in and a lever waste
why mental like
oh
but this isn't
the overall long time
philosophers is a colleges new prolonged and a gate
second ahead
could change or mental faculties
that diseases like syphilis could make it rain
that
chemicals like caffeine and alcohol in effect
how do you think
what's new is
we canal and deferred way see
the direct effects of mental let
somebody with
a severe and for frau
loss of mental faculties
the deficit we shall
corresponding wait
in her brain
op
so i may use a imaging techniques
like cat scans that
annette a minute
illustrate that different parts of the brain are active
at very different parts of metal wife
for instance
bob
the v. c. words fearing word leading word to generate
in correspond to different aspects
what are your brain is active
to some extent
if we put you in a memorized
stand
and observed we're doing in real time
by looking at activity patterns in your brain
we can tell whether
you're thinking about music
we're speaking about sex
to some extent we can tell
what do you saw the world paula
purses ambiguous
this is no surprise
while we artwork use of our purpose
brains
but it is extremely difficult to it
why
bob
one is a tulips
now
so you have this
the scientific consensus is that
all of mental wiping clean consciousness in the motions
and joins more outing
part of products of rain and it
so
you would expect that when you ripple windows
thought
and look at the brain
you see something for it
you zealand out
a big shiny theme of glass to send
blinding white sand
and sparks and
wonderful commerce
and
actually though the brain just discussed that
oh
it looks like a gun all equal
it's not
it's it's grey
when you take a better act
top grade matter
that is because our effect
as i did it is bright red has
whole single blot
it doesn't even if he's good
oh
well
is anybody every the brain
i mean it's a cream sauce but everything's good
tough
tillotson question is
how could something like that
give rise
twice
and you have some sympathy
for portray cart as another argument a carpet made as a lot less
and what he did make witches
the hanging
responsible for free will and love and consciousness
ridiculous
what i wanna do what what the goal of verify
it is
to make it less rigid
the trial explained
how the brain
works
how the brain can give rise to flop
what wanna get to basically first that this question
ah
but is something will continue to discuss throughout the course as we talk of a different aspect
that's a wife
what i wanted to though now is provided the pictures of one of the list
your thoughts law
with the smallest
the interesting part of the brain
and then get bigger bigger
talk about a small part of the brain
and your city is building blocks of plot
combined other mental structures
and in the defense of parts of the brain
finding the whole thing
so
one of the discoveries of psychology
is that
the basic unit of the brain
appears to be vendor
you're honest specific sort of syrup
annette you're on past
three major parks
as you could see illustrate it
your honor that look we get one another
this is a typical one
the rugged then rights
the assault and the polls
here
and then brightest
yet signals
her mother
at the signals can be either
so editorial
which is at the rays of light withered under op
fire
or in the torch
in that they will work
the likelihood that under fire
the cell lying sums it up
they give you an average medically
excited tory
signals are causes
the bedding imagery monster finances
and if you get a certain number
the or something
the novel fine
pirates
on acts
you think you're right
that's not news
much longer than a dent rights
and in fact some absence or maybe she walked
and there's a maxim leading triggers
why won't work
here they took
for instance
it is so shocking rights garth
um
sir rounded surrounding the victim liam a chemical metaphor
that would lead a cart to despair
poet
oh
for rallying
that sobbed is a my lunch
which is actually does insulation
it out firing
so there are some facts about girls
there are a lot of them
about a thousand billion of them
and each year on to be connected
to
a ramp
thousands breath hints of athens
whether it's
so
is extraordinarily complicated
during the pipes
not haven't read flavors
there are sensory neurotic which take information from the world
so as you see me for instance
bob darn arrives firing from your read on
sending signals your brain
there are motor odds if you decide to raise your hands
those are motor bronx
telling a muscles what to do
and there are intern or aunts
which connected to
and basically interference
you think
date
make the connection between sensation act
all the use of a believe
and as a sorting out what it might cost course many years of what lecture
that parents
i do not grow back once you lose them
ah
they never get back is actually
not true
their parts or brain with which your arms
and
we broke
one interesting thing about marilyn says
and there are less like a gun
either fires or it doesn't
or nothing
ah
if you squeeze the trigger of a guy really hard really fast
fire any faster armour
the navy displeased
gentlemen
bob
it seems to these
right
what happened your honor
the or nothing
when sensation
very great
if something necks to porsche
on your head
bob
the degree of pushing
the able to notice it is not either pushing or not with me
you didn't
the liza footing
that means if the
degrees of brightness
i messer is on arose or or nothing either a wasted
oh intensive
so one simple way potent and study
is a number of iraq's firing
more
europe's more and
another way to increase intensity
is the frequency of firing
ah
so
others use oats to the first one is a number of darius fired
one is a frequency of fire
enact something is more intense
davis
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang them
back
back
bang
these are two ways
to which vermont in cloak
intensity
now
your office
are connected
and a popped one another
any use of the thought they would try to one another
but if you like to take wires you connect wire
which of the wrap round
ah
because this is indicated
but mirrors
for late one another chemical a
in a kind of interesting way
sweet any your ops
swing attacks on wander
and again right of another
as a twenty jack
the gap to be a boat went and balance
nobody to watch
you think best move yet
and as gap is known as the senate
what happens is
women are on fire
annette incense
shoo in to the gap
these chemicals are known as neuro transmitter is
op
any effect again rights
so your aunt munich eight one another
chemical it
these
again
the chemicals could
excite the other girl
senator cory
bring up chances of a fire
when hit another nerve
is it for it
now
neuro transmitter is
come into resting
because a lot out
psycho farm apology
bob
most of the medical sort banner read regional sword
you sis
of giggling with bureaucrats
and so you could you see it as for some examples
stop
there are two sorts of ways you can fiddle with neuro transmitter to
corresponding wing
to sorts of ropes
there are agnes
when agnes us
is it
increases that that are transmitted
either by making more pressed matters
we're stopping cleanup america's matters
or in some cases by taking an are friends
women make use of facts
in there and happiness
that slowdown about nerve transmit
it is a destroyed neuro transmitter to
we're in a gephardt read more
when some cases they both began right under on
and even a peace over
so the neuro transmitter scan connect
as for these clever weights
better odds
can effect
your natural light
so for instance
ah
there is a private known as ferrari
and for our a. palm
isn't it had been asked
is a very particular sordid and agnes
it
it walks motor girl
from affecting muscle fibers
with this does then is it our lives
the vision vulgar arrives
then the command
to your arms is that it's a look got
it doesn't work
you say judgmental existed to move it doesn't work
the motor bronze
our party activated
ah
and then because
the way you leaders through modern arrived in doc
there's alcohol
alcoholism fitted to work
now this may be puzzling says people it is my only paradox
because you may be thinking
alcohol is not in the report
on the convert
when i drink a lot about hop
i use my inefficient and become more converse
i become
i become more aggressive than warped
sexually vibrant and something more beautiful
and and
so
we were always alcohol and gathered for a while
yes there is
a
is it gets
they may be in the tory party afresh
so you hap
parts of your brain that are basically telling you now heartbeat
okay
he defends lot
don't give me buy me
ghali is that works
alcohol collapses
shuts down those parts beverage
if you take a knock out all the been goes down
to invaded excited toward parts of you for
a new fault for that so
and that means
increased amounts
the route slopes
in particular they preached about nora than ever
and your transmitter as responsible for
just
general aroused
and so i'm threatening to clue drugs lakes
ah
there are
ah
prozac or chase your phone and
when we discussed clinical psychology depression
bob
will learn extent to which neuro transmitter disorders
our
in book injured disorders like depression
and
one problem is
that out
profession
visitors to lavender transmitter
answered
bob
prozac
makes your coleman
more prevalent
and so some extent i tell thee eight
depression
ah park and since disease
is a disease and bobbing
in a motor
for all loss of more control
the move it
one factor imparted scissors
to lavender transmitter
no mistook me
the drug elbow up
greece is of vital public
and so does something to the
a levy of these temporarily
the symptoms of our concerns
the abner odds
under cluster together
and if i may communicate with that
so how is a soul work
to give rise to preachers of the two interesting things
hawkins think
well again
it used to be a believe that the brain is wire out like a computer
with a p. c. or matheson
but we know this can't be true
can't be true
this is two ways in which the brain is better and
for one thing
the brain is highly resistant to that
if you have a laptop
and i persuaded open up
for me
and i take the flyers
because that just about anywhere
your lab will be destroyed
the brain is actually more brazilian
you can't take a lot of brain death
and still
preserve some mental function
to some interesting sensors on sort of
damage resistance
built into the brain
that allows different parts are free to take over it
damn
a second consideration is
the brain is extremely fats
you can't hear workshop
wired what custody
we're playing
uses tissue
and she was extremely swap
the paragraph that is
have you created a fast and it was such
well stop
you tell what it is it a brain was wired with the first computer
it would take you
four hours to recognize
but in fact we could do things extremely quickly
so the question dentist
oh he is the brain what
and that's areas
unlike many to bomb a mike
commercially generated years
the brain works with our op
protest massive we are distributed protest
there's a whole lot or research
and this is research some of which takes place outside psychology department
in an engineering apartments in fear signs of farmers
trying to figure out
how
i didn't hear it into the same things
please don't
in one way people this is
they take
came from nature
and a tribes fraught
nasa we distributor
now works
did you aspects of reason
it is a very simple
competent network
that
is interestingly does come look
the winner arms
and this is often know this girl network
and people who study this
setting
your own network walk
to try to build smart jeans
i'm linda actor brains
stop
in the last twenty years
or so
this isn't a fusion vibrant areas
people are trying to why robert she'd
and you praying like thanks
from components
the local lot wagner oxen are wired
oh
one
consideration all of this
is it is a very young vila know we know that you would
there is no ritchie yet
i can recognize faces
for understand sentences
at the well to your opium
there's no initiated into this with anything people too
in an interesting way
this isn't far
because the human brain is wired up next
for therapy more complicated way
then the shores of folder that work
this is sort of scheme that diagram you not responsible
oh
of parts of the visual vortex
and if they to realize about this is
this extraordinary simple fact
so the brain is a complicated
system
now huh
so we've talked a little bit
about
the basic building blocks
of the brain
your odds
bob
we then talked about how neurotic and jimmie make a two women
then turned
founder odds are on
our wired up to get
now let's talk a little bit of a different part truth
out
the something's you don't actually need your brain to do
this diary of what you believe
the brady bill
as often brought upon us we're not
that all itchy
where does actually been friends a lot
we would be kept the people
and when asked if he kept a people psychologist refresh the body
the head was person and search
just as the reflexes
so what i gruesome
but we not
or something you don't need your brain
you don't need a brain
for newborn docking
ah
when flex asian withdraw from pain
you and pull back even if your head is gone
direction of the penis indicative of rain
vomiting
also that the repair
i i
and in a volunteer
very simple this one fault
it excellence
any of the vote
did you stand up
the end
this is a new church what's their what's
the opposite
if you will ever have
and one hand flat
that's what exquisite textbook
edition
bob
perfect
we'll notices
you heard much
we are notices
this fitness and went back up
this is something automatic
instinctively
and is not require your brain
do you brain is even for everything
what does your brain
well a something's that your brain does
involve very low level lunch for months
tom
these are called salt orbital structures
because you're bobo look for tex
the underneath the portraits
so friends eskimo yet there is
a diagram of the brain the waiter beaches diagram is
this is if a worldwide raymond facing this way
when he gets caught
yeah yeah
and you see
the brain
so this is the frogs
over here
that's the back
ah some key parts are illustrated here
the mid to upper incense
he is
responsible for
heart rate restoration
is very deep within the brain
and if it gets damage you that you're likely to die
the sarah fella
is responsible for body balance and muscular were nature
and again you again
feeling for the complexity of the system's
the survey teams approximate thirty billion or
the height of ala messages possible here
kiki
hunger
thirst
the some extent
sleep
and here's the same brain hearts
you close up
it
now
will these parts are brains are essential
many of the reportedly interesting
where the action is
is the portraits
this beautiful
ah
the court that says it overweight
and outer layer is all crumpled up
the romano why you bring with wrinkles
bob betty physical problems
if each were killed somebody is vortex
in flat adapt
give you a two feet square
sir what can i tell it rot
ah
and
the court next
is we're all one needs
the explodes
fish don't have any of that
so no rents a fish when it's fish don't have much of an adult life
reptiles and birds have a little bit about that
for a mate
the humans have a real lot
the percent of the volume of our brain
bell
ah
and the court decks
can be broken up into different parts
we're waltz
there is a free again this is facing
in profile court
there's a frontal up
easy to remember this
our thoughts
ah
the arrival
hello
and it's improved
and when the letter returned to his
this is that the brain
it's this is in fact
the lap
of the brain
another half a right that everything's duplicate
with some slaves
differences
what's really weird one really we're fine
about the slopes
does that include koppel logical maps
they include massive your body
oh
there's a cartoon
which actually illustrated classic
dammit
by some physiology us
go for some reason pack
at a dog's brain opened up
the service shocking different parts of a break
it a brain surgery waffle because
frank
itself has no
are you stuart
and it turns up at the top one is that part of this break
slade would pick up
and it's got leopard than fields
a medical university
to do the same thing with people
so you know suffering surgery
the ethel like to pulling the song i would do this
is it is acting up
and go
proceed
dear body with
more than that
we zach other parts or brain
these other parts of rain
people claim here chaps
in other parts are boring
people would claim
to experience
and to his research
another research
it was found aftermath
in the brain of a baht
there is a map in the motor park
mulder court bets
ah the soared up on laughs
and a sense record facts
of the soar
the patsy on right
if you can you tell what's what
by opening up the brain and shocking different parts
you know sparkle correspond to parts of body
bob
joe
in indictment
that tuesday's notice
but these maps
ah
for sisters papa
papa graphic
what this means is
if two parts of that
your honor body
bobby close together on a break
so you're out
it is closer to your drop
it is tier
get it
nobody
so too
in both the most report next
vanessa messes reports
also you'll notice of this
i.'s of the body part
representative brain
does not correspond to the size of body art
in a real world
rather what determines the size and rape
is it
state of his extent to which either they have more matter
for sensory
control
there's a whole lot century organs resist
focus on top
that's when it's o. k.
and enormous amount on a face
by the year on year the shoulder
this event vivian a cut on that
w. shoulder maybe begun it's hot
to some much going on
in fact
if you try diagram of a person
what their body is corresponding to that this matters
you get something
pat
that's your sensory
why
booth
now
so yeah these acts in your head
this thing to realize this
is that a party portraits
the things realizes
that's important part
what goes on your brain
but
less than one quarter of the vortex
if he's maps for production merits
the wrath
is involved in language and reasoning immoral thought
and so on
and in fact a proportion as you go from rack have of humans
less than less of it
is the vote to projection heirs and warm more
bob thanks
so well
have we figure out
but that other parts
of the brain do
well there's all sorts of methods
typically czar
we see imaging methods
like hast man
head scan
and if memorized
ah
which
as i said before show archie a brain work
if you wanna know which party rain is responsible for
language
you could put somebody to a scanner
i have
exposed to language or doing was the passport office something
and and see what parts of your brain
our act
ooh
another way
to explore
with the brain death
to consider what happens to people
when very bad things happen to their prey
bob is that things could happen to lesions
to worst
two strokes
ah to injury
for most part earl psychologist a white helmet laws
bob
you're a psychologist baba motorcycle was right that helmets
because you have for blacks events
we gain three insights into how the brain works
i'll been a logic is
find somebody crew levi debate
to damage to this part of the brain right here
and that person
can't recognize vases
there's some reasonable way that this part of the brain
is related to faced
couldn't it
op
and so chris i mean
praying back
undecided but we begin
james understanding
of what different parts of radio
as a vehicle stony brain damages
ah prevented people kate's
mulder control
such as cracks ia
what's interesting about cracks the artist
it's not a route
some revoked racks yet
to move
two simple movements just fine
but it can coordinator
they can do something like waved goodbye
we're like a cigarette
present notre
and ideology is a disorder which is blindness
as a first could still see perfectly well
all eyes are intact
but rather what happened tonight notre is
they they they pose a village recognize
sometimes is a stripes as psychic blindness
stop
and so they make it visualize notre and was devoted to recognize
they may get those effect no trap
and visibility
to recognize
faces
there are for your discourse of sensory neglect
some famous disorders
again it's not paralysis is not blindness
would you do certain parts of europe and argue brain
you might lose for instance
the idea
that is a lassiter bought
or left side of the world
these days or so interesting
one of devote some time to class minute
few weeks
disgusting
there are disorders of language
like half a shot
the classic case was discovered by paul broke that
in eighteen sixty one
haitian elect average parted his brain
and can only say one more
and
and avert a cat and cat
and
and everything else was gone
ah
there's other disorders of language
where a person could speak
very few what way
but the words don't make any sense
and he can't understand it what else
others orders of all this guy's later on
look wired psychotic
we're damage to argue brain to kuwait
related to the frontal blokes
bob robbed you of the ability to tell right off
the final at one end
we're talking about parents can actually hear around town loser wired up
parts of the brain what the different parts
at one end like a committee to habits of the brain
asked the question how many minds
you have
now if you look at the brain
if he took the brain out held up
it would look phrases at all
that actually is not
their actual differences
between the right hemisphere intellect
having people here
our right hand
and people here are left hand
honey people here for a complicated
and he gets tourist don't know
that of the right to left
those of you were right handed
ah
which can prizes of a minute and people
have a language in your left hemisphere
an effect would be talking of a right handed people
for most of the minimize agent
well talk about
those of you or left handed
are more complicated
some of you language in your right hands turf
some in your wept hemisphere
some god knows where
um
now the idea is
that's something for duplicate
so if you lose half your brain other act actually to a lot
but something is a war prevalent and more powerful
in one part or brain
another
what should you put a film clipped sighted american illustrates
the differences in hemisphere us
before doing that one of rights of eater battery
fast
bob
some functions are adolescent typically language and left again
this is a rape and eccentric
say
but you're right have a language of wept
back in music honor right
there's a cross over
and is important when we think about the studies that will follow
cross over is
everything you see in a wept ritual feel closer writes are you
everything in the right visual field
also lassiter
and similarly as a cross over nafta
three raven is ripples website vibe
you left hemisphere
controls rides
back
finally
the two hats are connected
they're connected by this move
we're at
call corp is blokes
annette is in a skip vest
because
the movie illustration
we're both from some of us
this illustrate certain things or discuss details
in a break
concerning the latter was a sham
a different parts
hello
kermit the past east
some left hemisphere summit are right and spur
we're also serves as a useful metal logical
ah
develop
which is a nice illustration
as to how looking at people
werner
we unusual
such as this man who had this brain
by sect
those weapons furnace rhythms
communicate
looking as if people's are ticks
dream cases
ever finds some understand
how we normally do that
and this again is a thing
or return to
to a corpse
bob
this is
generally the general introduction of the brain of what
five
giving a framework for wealthy talking about
later on throughout the course of that
i might later on a reference to your aunts
for neuro transmitter sport
hemisphere
you're sure that background understand what i'm talking about
but
the one in this first real class
with
a victim elite
as to what psychologist no window
so the idea behind a lot of psychology
will your assign
the minors knew from asia
as he will average computer
bob
and so we study
different problems like recognized faces were language or vulgar
we're logic
that he then often disfigured
how was work program
to solve these problems
in a wiggle walk fast
how could this program dudes can't shoot it
in the physical plane
so we would song be steady people logistics
sorry i can hear from
black person
and i think the backpack
this strategy is one very enthusiastic about
but there still remains
what's sometimes called our problem
consciousness
ms and subjective experience
what's it like
to my computer
karen
floyd cats
my computer can
recognize members
you bet
and maybe it doesn't
when that same way that i do
like it here
doesn't have feelings
in the same sacks
stop
this is cesar to classic illustrations
is it from a very mozart
the illustrates hanks
i think it's starship to vote on purpose or something
bob
and i will work it max
oh
and so the question is
has a thing like that
give rise to contests
there is
it is it the polls open
although some psychologists and philosophers think they shop
most of us are a lot more stepped
most of us think we have
so far we go forward and to reflections the cocks
i'm completely step
how is that anything so remarkable says
the protestants comes about
as a result of your katie your visit
just as i compatible
here's efficient
jeannie
when a lack of slack
seems like that
that of flashy loan greatest is the meat
can give rise to the thirties humans
the second victim of a ball in the grass on
is it
i am presenting your presenting throw us a master
wait and hop mechanism conception of what
i'm not only talking about beautiful it is now wonderful it is babs
jerry's it is
rather we find books
why not
what we try to explain fundamental aspects
of ourselves
flowing questions like are really decision
why we love our children
what happens when a follow up
and so on
yeah
you might find
this sort of project
in the air
to be worked out
you might
for a
about how this well this matches
few minutes fact
resist
when we deal with another illegal and morals
we think the terms of free will responsibility
if if if you were trying you caught me off
you chose to do that
you know he reflects badly on you
if you stabilize the risk you're out
you're big you deserve
greg did something wonderful
it might be hard to match this
with conception which will actions are result
you're chemical physical processes
it might also be apartment notions such as
for the intrusive rowdy people
and finally by the heart
to match the mechanism of mine
with
i did people that's
faced with this attention
there are three possible it's
you might choose to reject assigned to the conception of the my
many people did
you may choose to
brace to wallace
project idea that frame
because possible for mental like
and we're jacques promises a scientists
alternative way
you might choose to embrace a scientific world view
and reject all the cubans facts
and are some philosophers and psychologist
would you just back
later free will
and responsibility and spiritual brian intrusive fry
are all lucia
besides that note
i didn't washed away
in modern science
or you could try reconcile
it a try at the euro tower
to matthew scientific view of mine
with
these human is valiant
you might want to serve
this is an issue which can return to
the records
boss humans
