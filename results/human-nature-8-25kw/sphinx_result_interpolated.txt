so why don't you talk about
iii today's lecture
ears
i asked ran the in the philosophical tradition
that books not act the way in which
you mean inter connected yes
can provide
meaning and the possibility for flourishing
but what's looks rather a cactus
sort
love
the logical detachment
ask away a
dealing with a
the inevitable
shoots
all the late it's
barry it's
and
there is to take a nation of all the outlook that will be considering today
in the context
the western tradition
can be found in the writings
all the philosopher
here is all wonderful
imaginary portrayed on him
from seventeen fifty
who
setting added table
famous lee with he's
paying
she used to walk
salt
his name
as you don't found the reading guide
epictetus
lived ad
the beginning ah
to millennium ago he made rapidly from
fifteen
to one thirty in the common ella he was only keenan
greek speaking
asia minor
and
was that spent wife living ii vote roman empire during that era
only portion all his life has
slave
here's some decide as to whether
tell the age of
team
or until the age of twenty seven biting indicates a significant portion of his life
with spent
beans
bravery
bottom actually gained freedom mats
o. point
either before or after gaining freedom
he started
bill works
and
philosophical outlook
all the tradition
known
ads
so is says
and the works that were produced
aw and see if the happen have survived
are to
the first isn't need turf
for volume
collection
ah but he's discussion couple range of topics
questions ii medicaid thinks the way that
questions about the way the world if questions indicates the mala teach
how does should understand the world
and also questions in ethics
and king addition to back
i survived beats
to ordinary bulk
that we read for today
the little
forty five happened rack
essay
known as
the handbook
which was
so there's that old
drooping recorded by one of epictetus us
students
preserved
you got wet
now don't want that epictetus produced in the context of the handbook
was enormously influential for most of the two thousand years
back to highs
being part of the western tradition
you to a killer this
let us
he's
that i used to show you a picture i act
easy drop
from
the library
ah
not not there
benjamin
adams
the second president of the units
who happiness book
in he is
collecting
being
eighty's
seventeen fifty
hello
laughter
edition
wait till their eclipse
i'm not are you think
you to know historically about
the volume that were reading
first don't translation operate
what in fact
don by
oh great
eighteenth century woman of letters
elizabeth carter
the the translation that we are reading he is
a more modern
versions of that
so uh yeah this work epictetus
john many called book
connects
ah
doses
so we've been introduced in this class go far
first to the writings
all played all
who he is a systematic philosopher in his views about everything
and his commitments are to a certain kind of
rational list formal it's
idea list philosophy
and we've been introduced
to the works
style aristotle
to rule one
ah please
writings
the
to mccain ethics
oh i don't list
to tradition the time tradition in the rustic jillian tradition
ancient philosophical world produced
i know are all the others
to mac
apple bce that had views about
almost
any question you could acts
among those was the v you know ads
stoics says
so ce oats how old
we've missed
you
underlying medic typical facts
about reality
don't move to
he itself
he is it but
organic
physical toe talents
that's and governed by what they call the locals
work divine he said
there he is
on order
to
the world
that activists i believe on human beings
given that
he is tomb
call today
you look kind all
virtue on this don't picture
e. s.
act think nina a pool are a
we've what resume tells you
nature good man
eat ghali not a long wait
the us
grand scheme of things
i'm not trying
fight against
what is
free divine
for
you
so it's that surprising that
elements
all up the stoic tradition
get haidt ah
being subsequent
do you think
traditions
in some ways the stoic of you
that the world is all well ordered and take
governor by divine reasons
live act a hard
all
maybe
all
the religious traditions that are familiar to you today
the question then becomes what he is demanded of your perspective what should you do
give these two things are the case
i want us stoics suggest is that you need to its
that
he is the consequences
ah but powered and goodness of the logo ce even though the week in which it is good for you maybe
on available to you
c.
i am back in order to do so you need to moderate or desirous
you need to avoid it back
emotion
and verified
come to act
the in the accord with music
so the contemporary you said that terms
stoic one who
that eighths
press offering in the face of paying
he not
on this
and all these pp
i think going to recognize that
how can we
all of the philosophers that we reading
this is part of systematic world view
the ag is not need to a little bit here and a little bit there
and we don't worry about pp
yeah see if they haven't
idea about the nature
fundamental nature of reality
of you about how we know that
and then views about what we ought to do as a consequence
now i see this
in the handbook
he is concerned
only with a small portion all the stoic pitcher
he's concert
basically
when writing
the very first
self
manual
he's trying to tell you
mr warden days
as saying
all of
ancient
roman world in about
the year
what true joan if you would like
and here is what tells you you need to do
you need to line a how to wrists
on appropriately to experience
i doing three things
you need to alter your purse axes
of the world so that you come human apprehended things in such a way
they don't
influence you
harmful week
we need to altered or desirous
with respect
to the world
hey unique
chance
clap sure you wore a white
in such a way
she's stay in august
drake and now
he needs instructor social malaysian is
in ways that will help you
thing
a commitment
i don't next strike a minute
how can you read
rumor the tax
how
i think it could ways all bloody each of this
it is
ah the bulk
into one of these categories
so for example when epictetus
how's that
that we need to alter our perception of the world
here is that we specific waves that he thinks we might
go about doing it
opponents
to this
instruction
the first is that we need to pp
i really classified things
you two categories
things over which we have control
more about that in a moment
i'm things over which
don't have control
so we need to jacked our tax
china needs
down
we need also
anticipate
no we're the world's
please i'm forwards
so we do not don't you know what is that one what is that tell us
but i'm not things that aren't up to us
we need says structured our expectations in such a weight
that we are emotionally prepared
for what will befalls
and again
more about that in the couples
right
yet we need to recognize
in some ways this is a some point of the first
the wall back
judgment
police
hey
we do turn the name
whether iv he is the case
that experiences
a fax
so those are three things that epictetus says we need to
do with wrists
get out of examples of
ought
each of them in a moment
edition would lie to us
thing that we need to
he don't we need to carlton make appropriate
drives
we need to get our desires and lined up with the world in such a way that we arts
operation
i know we need you this
he is by converting
and relation
queen desire
and the world
usually a
desirous
graf
away things
aunt
lecture wish they were
i desiring for only yesterday
but they're not be
the snow day in three weeks
for my children
but the world refused
cooperate
on back
question
hackett if that they just did my desires
the world
i desiring that things go want exactly as well those
dec
then i would happy
contents
make their presence
in my office
this i think that epic
hume
he in
strategy i think
do you says it's
to ordinary feeling capacity
to a silly things from one categories
things pp
from
another
so now i showed you
the way ce in selection task
anything we tag
i
a and a half
and of four and a sad end
and a half which cardinal had to turn over to
growing whether it was true
that isn't a on one side
there's a seven on the other
doin' that
half
was
part
what wish you to vanity structure only identical to another task
attack
of being shown for cards
which had beaches
alcoholic or non alcoholic drinks
and a after which cards you need
turnover
to verified it true that if somebody ease drinking a beer
then she is over twenty won
all three were able to i'm nervous then
the difficult problem
you like all the problem with respect to which you had
i see it is points not to was that we have
don't sack
for letting go
we have a skill sacked
for
the logical
we have a few seconds think
stop happens
any document
and what he said yes we do when it cannot give an example of this
to learn not to us
certainly
the finger which we find
hard to let the wealth
to the things which we find it easy
collect a lot
and there i text
floyd his capacity that we have
for metaphor it
understanding
certainly in this category epictetus point that the dump
ah habitually be near soft
the indebted ability
all the loss
here's some bad news for all of you
you were
when to die
shall we take in half in the entire
course about this
about coming to terms
we it these inevitable fact about human existence
but epictetus sid don't
why
i own is on board
profoundly
in a way that the facts
see you
not just
the lab love
being able to utter the words
i will die some day
but the level of we lead
habitually eating it
to you or relations to things
oh awesome own
things that seemed incredible lead
important
loom
last of
for the
i think he did points out the importance
few points
you were
in ways that blank
can the norm is your culture
you what some you might have nature pointed yet
nay didi its social feedback
somehow creature actor capitals
describes the importance
all the resisting social pressure
when people say are you
you are seeking honoring gloria you must be a loser
epictetus senate
lap and face now
they're not what they say
about two
and at that point acts
here
they are almost gifts
teen packages that
five
strategy
certainly
she give you a kind a trick
so that he wants you to call today
most to be
kind of silent
pulse say stop and you just
calmly
it will respond
sell this
strategy
that he's presenting to ask
to remain parts
am i doing the next
all black tourist to run through some ce
samples
obvious
looking first act epictetus is tax
according a direct link
and then
yeah things song contemporary and alarms
the white these epictetus is talking about
so they don't paragraph
ah that the key pieces handbook
he is one of the most
they missed
all philosophical writing
in the western tradition of the last two thousand years to begin sense olive
something interact to laugh
some things are not act
last
are up do your accept hats
and are impulse is
our desires our versions
in short what every these are only doing
i'm not are not up to
blacks
betty is though that the coal
gods nor ark
it is
our reputation as our public office the is
whatever it is not our own doing
now this canada lining point out
a mistake you can make
the finn otto asa wright nature of
read a and hundred and i mean bce
he did where is the things that are not apt
wise
and that means blade
he angered and not parking
what do you think that things that are naturally in slate
that are not up
see you
oh no your own if you think think naturally in slate turf
free
with that things that are not your food are you
you will be
from what it
miserable
up sack
and walking round leaving the world for everything that
going wrong with
the midst think ah
do you think
that over which you have control
and that over which you lack
cool
needs to
what did he
upset
miserable
leading us
i cooked craft keeping these categories
plate
brings the greatest
cries
if you think that only one easy wars is worse
annette what is not your ponies not your own
i
no one will ever call worse you
no one will ever hindu you will blame no mind you will what not
hughes anyone
you do not us
single thing unwilling wit
because it oh things over which use
i happen to fall
what are the things over which
you actually don't have control
i never consequences no one can course you
because you're only concerned about the things that are opt
see you
no one can hear you
b casa nobody can get in the way at all the things that are
now
do you
who has experience with
a frannie
or relative
when acquaintance
who has taken part being
one that bald
the many
contemporary virtues
epictetus
in the four modest out
progress
knows that at the hard love the contemporary it
well stacked
why if
a version of all this epic
what
what to elite incurred more most likely
first
i rang the bell
and that is
as a renegade prayer
which you can find
decorated
humming birds
and
yeah fidel ce god grant me the serenity to accept the things i can act
ange
courage to change the things that happen
and wisdom
to know the difference
if morning glorious archer style you can find it decorated it
dole
or and angel
or a young child
you can find it
on a bowl
poor most striking we
you can find it
how can be
plan your part
for your style
or your side
still
do you marries
think he in yet
next leaks tomb the contemporary
mind
i think ce to mccain own way
that when i did and will indicates
for serenity prayer
i've found
how does and thousands of images like this
he in any language you can
thank up
so this i don't that we need to does
think wish
between things that we can change in things that we can act
and that i haven't heard of its
we're think habits and although effort
is what's appropriate towards things that we can
he is a laugh and that ethics
he gets
hats
offered
to
the western tradition
second example epictetus how class
a body may what is
ah a motion awaken nation
the room
anticipating what we yell
and cgsc
to you
in a particular set
so he sat
oh you are going to gold
tomb
the bats
when you are not to take some sort of action seven that are self what sort of activities
it could take a bath
oh you're mine
what happened to have
left their people and john fool
there people were in some think
don't v airport
what
benefit bleeding along line
parrot for the fact judas
reading they are needing to wait for your take it
you can i just
to work emotion
so natal
to yourself
what to take a back
i wanna go to the airport
i want to walk across the
someone please
i says i bought
oh i wanted you shall be in a way that
my choices iii upward
do you appropriately expect things to be
they are
then you will not be
drastic
i wanna walk across campus
then i sci day
i really i bet came walking across campus on an icy day
i'll need
kings lived my feet
rather than with them
that we each had pp
previously been on under worry it's
i ce to be
fact about the world
which he is
not pop
to me
i don't quite believe it
something which does not
herb
mind
feeling called
call
very faint epictetus suggests
do you
you see to what guys
that what he is
thank you os
i'm not
things that happened a
but not them
our judgments
about those things
i knew i hoa when i showed you that image from the metropolitan museum
ah socrates dat
upon drinking that hamlet
and to fooled you
that
ah yeah
john with nobility
recording it by a good key a party to it
something true but with socrates
and
of
carpenter bce
from nasa right
you section he says
one can third wound
all
how bce don't
for people's thoughts
about how to deal with
human life
and it's indebted abilities
so epictetus search what think people are not things but they don't think about those things for example
yeah pp
mean it's not the senate
my could be nothing dreadful
poor i word dreadful then socrates
the great wise one
what a hacked out to to be dreadful
what ask don't about jack
not decades
sal
what is a dreadful about dad
ease the judge made
about
yeah pp
that beat eased
dreadful
nothing you
he is
harmful mean it's
it's ah true you leather united
harm
when you teach your children not to be ops
why
bill thought list wants
ah there classmates
what you talk to them it he is
what a classmates
say about them
them
i laugh
it's emotionally disturbed ii
if you don't
if you don't whacked it hurt you
you to richie
i'm can find morrison given to this
for the would be a
playing hamlet
even famous rosen trance and gilded mr
scene
ah
hamlet
check could actually therefore you because then you stand there is
hamlet
happening in one of the colleges
you a couple of weeks
sol candidate in conversation with these two and a fairies
and complaining about what our rotten place
denmark
yes
i
they disagree
they set up
then not dawson strike us
as still ban
and famous elaine hamlet
says
back
why then do you
for the jury's not think he their buddha were bad but
king makes
so
when you walk round the world
think hack shades
and sighs
miss it
cable is
rex handler
these walls are
white
the temperature is back in fact these are
world
but don't don't have begun says
attached to them
not at the hatched
to an event
that haiti is good
war bat
it is us a half minutes
ah be event
that gives it back
the lets
that's the third at the teaching
points
fourth point
i tedious
following for
out
that there are two liza all having
science
one can on the one hand
half the world to conform to what you want
oh i think tank
as you want
conform to the world
epictetus papers
hey do not want hackett bank
you as you want them to
what if i
maud them happened
i made you
i
you were life will go well
certainly get out
hundred percent yelling key that to get what you want
i want
what you get
if you want what you get you will get
to want
still concert philosophy how as a way it called
writings
i'm one of the ways of thinking about it be use this notion of a called direct
think about what i shopping list
so because i had fun part to make left over from mac
signed with the double a few weeks ago
thought i'd use it for my shopping with
so here i am on enlightened by epictetus and i right on my shopping list that and interact
hers
broccoli and when you sit
and so i go to the store and the both o' out my desire depend upon their be
apple
broccoli
and
let's
you so
enlightened by a epictetus
go through this store
look and see what's there
paul latch apply to take during make you a next
apples
broccoli and lands
so our there's no difference between else
even though you worse
strategy
was to shake your desire to fit the world
i cracked iii
what's to try to shape the world
get my desire
but what happens to whites
when the store
helped
broccoli
i have on my nest
how whose
want to lead
and lemons
dick do you know all
and sat back
frustration
you ill will
i can track and fitted so i have to don't
you want
what
what
so how
it you show nest
and everything is
fine
the act the mood
i do year
is that if you shave your desirous to
the way things to act
we are
you will never are
b
frustrated
fourth suggestion
work
one of you must be keeping count
proper perspective
so i epictetus offers this
to ordinary analogy
he in
paragraph seven
he said own voyage when your boat had banker
if your ticket
less water
you think about small selfish
can a vegetable by the way
it human keep yuan fixed on the don't
and we'll go round frequently in case attacking call
if you carl
you must what all those other things books
so you will not be
well now the ship like life
the i'd he is a
sure go mad
ensures staff in the world
but don't let yourself be hackett tax
when i'm need your prior year comes
keep famous being a word or in your mind
what he continues think he is how wiki seem like
you not had a great to shelf wish
and
tomatoes
this is how our doesn't like to mind quoting again
if you are given a white
and each what
in ce doughnut beds doubling the small selfish
that should not
endure you either
what did it happen pools
let all things go and mind the bow bit
out
turning back
i was strategies that you have available for you
for do you would think this
chris trey should ce you recognize
and adopt bill was attitude towards things whose trenches
he is painful
to you
when you org job wakes he says you say that it bought a broken job
when you war
child is lost
ce
that is bought a lost
china
do you say
he is
the logical
consequence
ah be outlook that i being
presenting to you
around
he gets
it's something really good
when it was the serenity prayer
it's think pretty going to
at the grocery store
it's not is pretty disturbing
when it fell wife
and
child
what do you think
that's going
on
i leave that for you as a question
and turn it now works
feud
the second day
that be read
word today
oh great work
composed
he in the sixth
thank to eat
in around five twenty four
why have somebody who's not trajectory blank
also
endure dudley
to the way that epictetus instead
epictetus you were call was born us
wait
and try to make sense
all of my things
the ruins
i'll ce offering
once he became free
boethius by contrast
was born into a noble family
what's enormously successful politically in his early years
i'd choose i used to went on to be
enormously successful political figures
i
he he s later years
moscow
imprisoned
for
treason
an beak how consolation of philosophy was one of the most
why didn't reading reproduced
works
all eats
and i it was ready for centuries and centuries by almost everyone
we have gorgeous illuminated menus
that shall wise
the story
so in this one here is a week he is
for hank
teaching
all
and here she is afterwards
locked up
in jail
now i do yet
jail
in prison you
where he is
tortured and
spring
oh yes can salsa
in ce
ralph
mind
engaging he in in a match america
we
figure that calls
philosophy
security philosophy
come to visit boethius
e. u.
he is
i'm what i philosophy sadness
you he him
he is
in many ways
like what epictetus was talking about
there he is she says
a wheel
while the
fortune
sometimes things start off badly
that that
sometimes things start off better
and get back
what do you hooking evidently
be a circle
to what comes to you
and to why please
taking
from
you
and recognizing
that very he is
nothing
to be got
other than to recognize that the if
he is the pattern that white
he is
to bowl week he is
enormously
liberated
recognize think
that
what gold along with pp
famous sees the possibility of using them
alice him to come to terms
we if
the race
on having lost
all that
c.
previously hack
what i wanted to you gain the final faction all the lecture
easy to return to a theme that we does
gossip
previously
question at all what philosophical utility their eased
works
during times of dicks
stream to rest
sol
my hope
cause you
rag
i had
that even if you don't recognize this settlement
can guess who he is
mrs admiral james stockdale pp
who was
i.'s among other things
ah imprisoned alongside john mccain
being and white
during the vietnam war
i was also the bike
so
candidate
running on the independent take it
understand
for
you were born
so jinx stockdale
i fixed don't you in the ink
rapidly moving them are that we read
stay
star think deed works all the classical tradition
he read epictetus he read by to the other acts
alex
he read in the egg
he read the obscene
and all he's worked hard all pp
he is
cognitive and emotional record far
when he in vietnam the following things happen to him
it was september ninth nineteen sixty five
i'd reading now from his book
what five hundred knots
right into a fact
the level in the little iv for airplane
a cockpit walls not even three feet up
hi
could disappear after it was on fire its control system shot out
after rejecting i have
thirty seconds to make my laugh
freedom
before i mended
in the main street of a little village right haidt ants
so help me out i whispered to myself
five years down here at least
i'm leaving the world of technology and entering
the world love
many pack hand
he says now quoting from the handbook
many at hand from the encourage young the handbook
i ejected from that airplane at that indebted from that airplane
juan
opening paragraph that we read a few moments ago
i'm spending that us don't
always keep
second files in his mind for a
the was things that are happen can be
those things that are not happen him another way it's
fame defense backed out
those things that are with the any that work
and those things
that are beyond his power
to win not awaits thingy
those things that are beyond what did not what it's free will
and though was that lie beyond it
oh ahmed things
over which you do not have control
which being a the contacts
all tortured imprisonment
r a huge number
ah
after that
can says stockdale
it will do you tenth
here and then of the i. a. b.
iv i am convict them
i need to lad
gall
ah
thought
that there was things will change
however
and this is crucial
everything in categories a he is
up to me
in my power
in my will
and bill us are the things that are harper the subject
from my total concerned
and involvement
need matter think food might pins might james my abrasions
mike read my join my judgments might happen to what does go about what's going on my cool good my own evil
ma i think true character says
stockdales can circumstances
which are almost unimaginable ii difficult
my character and my wrist
bonds
to those things
our
to
need
i he goes oh oh to describe the dix
ce periods
oh
torture
you saying
ah true up
that we've seen repeatedly in the text
correct
he said s
when tortured
what we actually get what and released from the torture what we contemplated
was
that we had indeed she in a certain sort all that
frail all pp ourselves them always
it was vietnam earned watts
stoic cart
how close the moral harm that we talked about
when we discussed the jonathan she work
a shoulder broken a bone in my backdrop into a leg broken twice work
she heights
in comparison
i think he is
look i'm not for any great up time than this
drawing the trustworthy
self respect ing
well behaved marin the u. ce
side too
sid you a chance of extravagant
that forced people
to discovered south africa
ah what they are capable that they don't wish
c.
are what is
most
harmful
when i don't says
it will do no good to being told by ce
selling points
leading your daughter
why then getting cold by selling rinse waving your soul
he's expressing the thought
to year
to you
when we brag being the discussions
all jonathan shay
about the experience
ah pp
feeling
that one had betrayed
what once stood for
that he is what led to a feeling of world are
and when children some depths
found selves cute
thing is that they
ballot
what paul said
two of them
they shivered
a shock
they felt ideas order in their souls
here again is an answer to
lyle cons
challenge
but notice
that
those
stop yale eased
you on board much of the addict
he's you don't think
the bit about
to miguel
and
the wife
that these
he rejects in epictetus
the idea that
social
relations
aren't
important
in a pair not how the one that i just wish it to you he writes this
follow us
when people are released from solitary confinement would put back in a regular cell block
how do you american came out of that it's
you're into that responding something like this
when first whispered to by fellow prisoner next door
