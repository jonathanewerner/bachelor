through the recorded bond one of epictetus is
students
preserved
mean that what
now noble and that epictetus produced in the context of the handbook
was an enormously influential for most of the two thousand years
back to highs
being part of the western tradition
you to a killer this
sections
please
that i use to show you up http sure at

wait till to eclipse
i you think
you to know historically about
the volume that were reading
first don't translation are that
what in fact
john by
of great
eighteenth century woman of letters
a list of if carter
the the translation we are reading is
a more modern
versions of that
so need this work epictetus
john many called book
can its
pp
to was says
some even introduced in his class therefore
first to the writings
all played all
who he is a systematic philosopher in his views about everything
and his commitments are to a certain kind of
rational list formal its
idea list philosophy
am reading introduced
the works
style paris that are
through one
ah please
writings
the
to mccain ethics
oh ii bonus
to tradition the time tradition in the with jillian tradition
each of philosophical world produced
i not all other ce
to mac
outlook ce that had use about
almost
any question you could acts
among those was the v you know ads
stoics is
so ce oats how
we've missed
you
underlying that active people facts
about reality
don't move to
he itself
he is but
organic
physical to a talented
the to govern by what they called logo ce
work divided reasons
the are he is
on order
to
the world
that activists what believed on human beings
given way that
he is tomb
called so they
you look kind all
virtue bond us don't nature
ii s
act think nina a pool are a
we've what reasons held ce you
nature good man
iv ghali not along we a
pace
grand scheme of things
i'm not trying
fight against
what is
free divine
for
you
so if you to prior things that
elements
all pp the stoic tradition
get haidt ah pp
in subsequent
do you think
traditions
in some ways the stoic of you
that the world the is all well ordered and he
governor by divided reasons
lived active hard
all
maybe
all
the religious traditions that are familiar to you today
the question then becomes what he is demanded of you prospective what sure to you do
give these to things are the case
i what us stoics suggest if that you need to its
that
ii is the consequences
ah pow work and goodness of the logo see the noble week in which it is good for you may be
on available to you
c
i am back in order to do so you need to moderate are desiring ce
you need to avoid acts
emotion
and verified
i'm to act
the in the accord week reasons
so the contemporary you so the terms
stoic one who
that
less offering in the face of paying
he not
on this
and of these pp
think good to recognize that
how made
all of the philosophers that we reading a
this is part of systematic world v
the a give not need to a little bit here and a little bit their
and we don't worry about pp
the i do you d having
idea about the nature
fundamental nature of reality
of you about how we know that
and then he was about what we ought to do as a consequence
now i see this
he in the handbook
is concerned
only with a small portion all the stoic pitcher
his concert
basically
when writing
the very first
self
manual
he's trying to tell you
mr org is
as saying
all of
ancient
roman world in about
the year
what true joan if you would like
and here is what hotels you you need to do
you need to mind how to was
bond appropriately to experience
by doing three things
you need to alter your purse axes
of the war also that you come human apprehended things in such a way
they don't
influence you
harmful week
you need to altered or desirous
with respect
to the world
i a unique
chance
clap sure you war like
in such a way
she's staying august
great and now
need to ce tractor socially issues
in ways that will how who
spring
can that the
i don't next striking that
how can you read
rumor the tax
how
i suggested ways all what each of this
to is
of the book
into wanted these categories
some for example when epictetus
how five
that we need to alter our perception of the world
years the we specific way ce that he things we might
go about doing
contents
to this
instruction
the first is that we need to pp
highly classified things
each you categories
things over which we have control
more about that in a moment
i'm things over which
don't have control
so we need to jacked our tax
and and
down
we need also
anticipate
no may the world
please unfold ce
so we do not are external what interact one what is up to us
latin look things that are and up to us
we need says structured our expectations into to wait
that we are emotionally prepared
for what will befalls
and again
war about that in nicholas
life
i we need to recognize
in some ways this is a some point of the first
the wall back
judgments
police
way
we determining
whether iv he is the case
that experiences
a fax
so don't read things that epictetus sense we need to
do with first
get out that examples
are
each of them in a moment
edition you would like to us
thing that we need to
don't we need to carlton make appropriate
drives
need to get are desiring that why not of the world in such a way that we are its
first
an the we need you this
he is by converting
added relation
queen desire
and the world
usually a
desiring ce
brass how
a way things

lecture wish they were
i desiring family yesterday
but their not be

to verify true that if somebody ii is drinking a beer
then she is over twenty why not
all three wiki able to hundred stand
the difficult problem
you like all the problem with respect in which you hackett
i keep is points not to was that we have
don't sack
for letting go
we have a skill sacked
for
the logical
we epictetus that for think
stop happiness
any document
i'm what he figure we do when the dental give an example of this
to learn not to us
simply
the think which we find
are to let the wealth
to think which we find the easy
collect all
and very i ebooks
like his capacity that we have
for metaphor it
understanding
what they in is categories epictetus concepts in pp
ah habitually be are soft
the in added ability
of lost
here's some bad news for all of you
you work
when to die
shall the to in has the need prior
for ce about this
about coming to terms
we it these inevitable fact about human existence
but epictetus secure http
why
own is on board
profoundly
in a way that the facts
to you
not just
the latin love
the able to under that works
i've will die some day
but the level of we lead
habitually
to you or relations to things
oh seven own
things that seemed incredible ii
important
move
last of
for they
epictetus a points out the importance
if you points
you
mean way use that mind pp
through the norm ce your culture
you what some you latin the to points that
nay keep its social feedback
so pow could to active africans
describes the importance
all the reasons things social pressure
when people say are you
you are seeking honoring gloria you must be a loser
epictetus sense
lack dan face now
an are not what they say
about to
and at that point how
year
they are almost gifts
mean passages that
five
john to
what in the
key give you a kind a trick
so they once you to call to the
most to be
kind of silent
able say stop and you just
calmly
the respond
style this
strategy
that he's presenting to as
to remain parts
am i doing the next
called lecture is to run through some ce
examples
obvious
looking first at epictetus is tax
according interact week
and then
yes things some contemporary and was
the white these that epictetus is talking about
so they don't care graf
that the key says handbook
the is one of the most
famous
all pp philosophical writing
in the western tradition of the last two thousand year ce he can sense olive
something interact to laugh
some things are not act
last
are up do year accept hence
and are you false is
our desires are versions
in short whatever is our only during
i'm not are not up
last
any is the the coal
gods nor are can
it is
our reputation is our public office the is
whatever it these not our endure read
now his canada one in points out
a mistake you can make
the finn i twice are by nature of
read a and hundred and i mean bce
need in where as the things that are not up
wise
and that means blade
hundred and not are who
what do you think that things that are naturally in ce late
that are not up
see you
are up your own if you think think naturally in slater of
free ii
with at things that are not your own are your who
you will be
from what if
miserable
up sack
and walking round is made in the world for everything that
going wrong with
the midst think ah
you think
that over which you hackett troll
and that over which you lack
for
need to
what a be
up ce that
miserable
relating s
i trafficking these categories
late
brings the great is
cries
iv you think the only what is in worry says you works
annette what is not your own these not your own
i
no never a worse you
no one will ever endure ii will blame no mind you will a not
use any when
you do not us
single thing and willingly it
because think oh things over weak use
hackett fall
what are the things over which
you actually to have control
i the quentin don't think or ce you
because your only concern about the things that are up
the you
no one can hear you
b consul nobody can get in a way at all the things that are
now
do you
who has experience with
a frannie
or relative
born acquaintance
who has taken part the in
one all
the many
contemporary versions
epictetus
in the for modest not
progress
knows that at the heart of the contemporary to
wealth that
lived
a versions all this at pp
what
what reading purge who war most likely
first
i reading would need
and that is
as a reading for
which you can find
decorated the
humming birds
and
yeah fidel ce god grant the the serenity to accept the things i can next
changed
courage to change the things that http en
and wisdom
to know the difference
if morning glorious archer style you can find it decorated
the all
or and angel
or a young child
you can find it
on a bowl
own most striking we
you can find the
how can be
hundred are are
for your style
war your side
still
do you very these
think he in yet
next need is tomb the contemporary
mind
i think ce to mccain own way
that when i good and will indicates
for serenity prayer
i've found
how does and thousands of images like this
he in any language you can
think up
so this i don't that we need to does
think wish
between things that we can change in things that would tear
and that and active ebooks
we're think how document called effort
is what to preparatory bce things that we can
he is a latin that hackett
he gifts
has
offered
to
the western tradition
second example epictetus how class
about the what is
although most to make a nation
the room
anticipating what we'll
in cgsc
you
in a particular ce that
so he sat
oh you are going to gold
tomb
the bats
when you are not i some sort of action seven that yourself what sort active eadings
you could take a bath
what hoa your mind
what happened to have
less their people and jonathan pp
their people war in so think
don't v airport
what
jonathan bleeding along why
parrot for the fact each in is
reading they are needing to wait for your take it
you can a jock
the work emotion
steady
to yourself
what to take the back
i what are the up more
i whites you walk up lost
to on these
i c ce i not
oh i'm what to do so be in a way that
as much once is enough up word
do you appropriately expect things to be
they are
then who not be
plastic
i wanna walk across can this
is in i sci day
i'm real mind that you walking across campus on and i sci day
i'll need
kings lived mind v
rather than with them
that who each had pp
previously be into on and early its
i ce to be
fact about the world
week ii is
not up
skim the
think are equired believed
something which does not
herb
mind
feeling called
called
very faint epictetus suggests
you
you see to what not is
that what he is
think to os
are not
things that happened a
what not them
our judgments
about those states
any what oh when i shoot you that in the give from the metropolitan museum
called socrates dat
upon drinking the handbook
and to fooled you
that
ah yeah
john with nobility
recording why of good key are each it
something true a list of socrates
and
of
carpenter bce
from nasa written
you section he says
one can third i
all
how cgsc phil
for people spots
about how to deal we a
human life
and its indebted the ladies
so epictetus search what think people are not things but their judgments about those things for example
yeah pp
mean its that he sense
my could be nothing dreadful
who it who are dreadful dan socrates
the great wise one
what happened to to be dreadful
what s don't about jack
not decades
style
why does and like full about gap
use good judgment
about
yeah pp
that the please
dreadful
nothing v
he is
harmful mean its
its ah true you leather united
harm
when you teach your children not to be up
by
the thought list wants
on their classmates
what you could i to vanity as a
what think classmates
ce about them pp
them
i life
even lotion we does derby
true don't
if you don't what encourage you
you to richie
i'm can find what is that into this
born to would be a
playing handbook
even famous rosen trans in gilded mr
full in
ah pp
how that
check could actually therefore you because en years and there's
hamlet
happening in one of the colleges
you a couple of weeks
sob could even conversation with these to and various
and complaining about what are rotten place
denmark
its
ii
they disagree
they say what
then not doctrines strike us
as so ban
and famous when hamlet ce
says
back
why bends do you
for their his not think even would war bad but
teammates
so
when you want around the world
think hackett shades
and sighs
the is
pp able is
rex handler
these walls are
white
the temperature is that in fact these are pp
world
but don't don't have v human says
text to them
not at how cgsc
to and the band
that ease good
war that
it is us that from it
all be iv that
that gives it back
the with
that's the third at the key to
points
fourth point
i key gifts
following for
our
that their are to liza all having
science
one can on the one highly
the world to conform to what you want
own one tank
as you want
conform to the world
epictetus papers
hey do not want hackett guide
you as you want and to
what if has
more them to happen
i made you
i
you war life will go well
you think again of
hundred percent yelling key the to get what you want
what
what you get
if you want what and get you will get
to want
so hence are in philosophy how as a way at called
writings
skim one of the ways of thinking about the use this notion of a called direct
i how what hotshot things
so because i had him courage make left over from next
find the double a few weeks ago
thought i'd use it for my shopping what
so here i am on in lighten by epictetus and i great on my shopping less that and interact
has
broccoli and once
and so white called to this don't and of of own how my desiring and upon their be
apple
broccoli
and
levels
you so
enlighten by epictetus
go through the store
look and see whites their
hoa latch apply to keep are and make human next
apples
broccoli and once
so are the is no difference between else
even though your ce
vanity
was to shake your desiring to fit the world
i cracked he
was to try to shake the world
bit by his side
what what happens to once
when the store war
helped
for hackett
i how mind madness
how who's
la can lead
and women's
it these noble
and sat back
frustration
you ill will
background practice are if that so don't
you want
what
what
so
it you show next
and everything's
find
the at c in
i do year
is that he if you shave your desirous to
the way things to act
we are
you will never are
b
frustrated
fourth suggestions
where
one of the most be keeping can
practical us back its
so not epictetus offers this
to ordinary analogy
the in
paragraph seven
he said own voyage when your boat had thankfully
if you not if
less water
you think about some also fetch
can of next able why the way
bit human keep yuan fixed on the don't
and what rome frequently intended attacking call ce
it he consul
you must what all those other things books
c will not keep
hoa not wish it guide life
the i'd he is a
sure rome around
ensures that in the world
but don't let yourself be hackett tax
when and need your prior year comes
keep famous mean order in your mind
what he continues think he is how wiki seem like
you not added when they to shelf wish
and
tomatoes
this is how does in like to mind reading again
if you are given a white
and each what
least doughnut next to born a small selfish
not should not
endure you ii the
what iv the captain pools
what all things go and mind the bow bit
out
turning back
think the strategies that you have available for you
for do you would things
courage trans if you recognize
and adopt ill was added to need towards things whose trenches
iv painful
to you
when your job great ce he says you say that iv bought a broken john
when you war
child these lost
ce
that is lot a lost
china
b
he is
the logical
consequence
ah be outlook that haidt being
free thinking to you
around
keep its
that something really good
when he was the serenity prayer
its think pretty go into
at the grocery store
its that is pretty disturbing
whites the wife
and
child
what you think
that's going
on
i leave that for you wealth a question
and turning now bce
to you
the second keep
that be read
word today
oh great work
composed
he in the states
centuries
in around five twenty for
why have some people is not could a period like
also
endure dudley
to the way that epictetus in state
epictetus you were called was born us
late
and try to make found
all believed whites
during in ce
i'll ce offering
once he became free
boethius by contrast
was born to a need to a noble family
was enormously successful politically in his early years
haidt true sorrows who when on to be
enormously successful political figure is
i
he he s made your years
mas are
imprisoned
for
treason
an be how consolation of philosophy was one of the most
why didn't reading reproduced
works
all its
at i is read for centuries in centuries by almost everyone
we have gorgeous than human a in an use
that shall was
the story
so in this mind here its a week the as
for hackett
teaching
all
and here he a is afterwards
locked up
in jail
now i think
jail pp
in prison you
wish ii is
tortured and
spring
otis console he
in ce
around
mind
engaging he in in a matching erica
we
figure that calls
philosophy
centuries philosophy
come to visit boethius
iii
the is
i'm what philosophy says
you he him
he is
in many ways
like what epictetus was talking about
their he if she says
a wheel
while the
fortune
sometimes things start off badly
that that
sometimes things start off better
and get back
what do you hooking edible ii
be a circle
to what comes to human
and to why please
taking
from
you
and recognizing
that very he is
nothing
to be got
other than to recognize that the if
the is the pattern that white
he is
to boethius
enormously
read the read
recognize think
that
what gold along with pp
things these the possibility of using that
alice him to consul terms
we if
period ce
on having lost
all that
c
previously hackett
what do he in the final section all the lecture
easy to return to of mean that we does
gossip
previously
question all what philosophical utility their eased
works
during times next
ce dreamed us
so
my hope
cause you
read
i hence
that even if you don't recognize the settlement
can guess who he is
the says admiral james stockdale pp
who was
among other face
ah imprisoned alongside john mccain ii
the in hanoi week
during the vietnam war
i'm can was also the bike
so
candidate
reading on the independent hackett
understand
for
you were born
said you stockdale
i free explicit he you in mean pp
added removing them are that we read
stay

he read epictetus he read by to the other us
stoics
he read in the a
he read the honest the
and all he is work part all pp
he is
how medieval and emotional practical are
when he in vietnam the following things happen to him
it was september ninth nineteen sixty five
