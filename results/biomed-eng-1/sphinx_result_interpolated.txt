this is a this is a course ab version of which i taught him almost every year for the last
the years
added a balls a little bit every eye year i think i get little bit better added
ah so hopefully you'll get some advantage
from that experience
but the idea is to try to present to you a sort of what's exciting about biomedical engineering
the ways that one can take
science and mathematics and applied that to a ca improve human health
a song not working alone here but we of
carried by teaching fellows who are affiliated with the course
two of which are here today yen aq who is
they are yen
frasier can higher
so everyone can see yeah and i worked on the course last year
and so that she's the and senior of the teaching fellows that are working on the course
at this year
serge cope set is in the back
tom band
the of the second that teaching fellow
i should mention the yen is a ph d. student in biomedical engineering and that's
serge is an empty ph d. student who's getting is a ph d. in biomedical engineering
good god teaching fellow
couldn't make it today is name is michael look an all introduce
to you i when he
when he's available
so this is that does that goal out for my first lecture today to try to answer these questions
and got in
a you might have ari notice
that i'm using the classes
the to server
i so the cell abyss is there accompanied over the cell of us a little bit later but
so this is available on line
the first that reading is available online
and all talk more about the readings
and when i get to that up course of a lecture here
and i'm been opposed to a power points for all the lectures hopeful we found at least the day before
i the lecture takes place why posted this last night
some as students bind that they come
benefit from printing out the power points than they can just take their notes along with the slides
go
and that's one way to do it but
ah but feel free to do it
how whatever we worked
are you with those should be available
questions i wanted tried a answer today are what is biomedical engineering
cell why would you be interested in spending s a master learning about this set subject
i'll talk about who will benefit from the course
and i a little bit about
that's or the detail
a
a
subject matter that will cover in the course of this acid master
so the
to answer the question what is
biomedical engineering were good
time on that today and will spend time
on thursday
on a one or protein from a couple of different angles
one is by just showing you a series of
cheers
i which you might not recognize and talk about why this is a digs
biomedical engineering
so this is one picture that probably you all
got you all know what it is when you see it the its unfamiliar
looking at image its sat something that probably we all have some personal experience with right this is a chest x. ray
ah that would be taken in on your doctors office
for example or or radio adjust opposite
and it is a a
a good example of biomedical engineering in that it
physical principal that is how do x rays
interact with the tissues of your body
any news is that
physics that physical principal
to develop a picture of what's inside your body
to look inside and see things that you couldn't see
i without this that device
and i don't recognize some of the parts of the image you can see the rib cage here the bones the concede
the heart is this large about bright the object down here
here i'm if your a
have good i site from the distance the year advocacy the vessels leading out of the
out of the heart in into the lungs of the lungs are these
about darker spaces
i within that rib cage
and and physicians over the years of having this instrument have learned how to be varies
kate about looking at these pictures
and a diagnosed saying
when something is wrong inside the chance for example
so this is an example of biomedical engineering one that is
well integrated into art society to the point that we've probably all
got a picture like this somewhere
a in our past
and a where we understand the physical principles
that allow us to to use it
we've gotten over the last two decades in particular very sophisticated about taking pictures inside the body
allowing doctors to look inside the body and predict things about our internal physiology
ah that they couldn't project
i despite looking at s are putting their hands on us
and this image on the top here is another example of a of an imaging technique
this is a plaza try mission tom a graph
p. t. t.
image
and is taken by using radio new clients
and inject in them into use a radioactive chemicals
that interact with tissues in your body a specific way
and you can see where those radioactive chemicals go
at allows us to look not just that the anatomy of what's going on inside your body like an x-ray does
to look at the chemistry
the biochemistry
of what's happening
inside a particular
organ or tissue in your body in this case
these are pictures of the brain
and a this is ben and exceptionally important technique
in understanding
hollow molecules like neuro transmitter is
effect disease and how they change in certain disease states and out people
and what will talk about this is another example
biomedical engineering
advanced methods for imaging inside the body
all this out that picture you can
probably see too much about the u.
by recognize what it is
where was this picture taken
kind of a space was a taken in
bob
somebody said o r are operating room and that's right this is a picture in in an operating room an operating rooms if you win into any operating room around the country
he was a lot six a ab examples of instruments that are used to
help of surgeons
by that
and is the zee allah just
i to keep the patient alive and healthy during the course of the surgery
and this particular one had down here this portion here is a heart lung machine
and this is a machine that can take over the function of
patients heart
and lungs
during the period when they're undergoing
open heart surgery
for example
they're having
a corner a artery bypass or they're having a heart transplant
then there's some period at which there
normal heart
there are
hard to stop
and this machine assumes the functions of their heart
and this is and
the obvious example of biomedical engineering building machine that can replace the function of one of your organs
even temporarily
for example a during an operation
this is another familiar picture ai a i. a. purposely picked one that looks sort of old fashioned compared to the usual way you see this which might be on the nightly news use
leap going across the screen to indicate that they got their finger on the pulse of what's happening
or you see it that tv shows like e. r.
i you see these images on computer screens all the time
it's an example of the k. g.
e. c. g electric hardy a graph
it said machine that also looks inside your body that looks inside in a in a different kind of way
rather than by forming in a major a picture
ah
electron some the surface of the body
and measure the electrical potential
as a function of position
on the body
it turns out that the electrical potential or electricity that you can measure on the surface of the body
things that are happening
for inside
like the beating of your heart
and if you put electorate in the right position and you measure in the right way
can detect
the electrical activity of the heart and record it
on a stripper quarter like this one ship is shown here
or display it on a computer
and
so this another example love
of biomedical engineering where you can
look
function of a heart
in a a living person
a and ad position whose experience that looking at a is
and a machine that works well
i've with those two things you can
diagnosed a lot of things
that are happening inside a heart
double talk about that about halfway through the corps

this ad picture might be less a familiar to you but you probably all know that we have developed over the last hundred years or so
the ability to take cells
out of a person
or cells atom an animal
keep those isolated cells to live in culture for extended periods of time
so this technology is called cell culture technology
reduce spend quite a bit of time talking about it during the third week of the course
and the out by taking cells from the skin for example or cells from your blood or cells from the bone marrow
bingham alive and culture we been able to study
how
human cells work and learn a lot about the functioning of
human organism
we've also learned how to
not only keep cells allied been in certain cases make them rapid k
outside the body so maybe you could take a few skin cells
and keep them in culture in the right way and wrap what kate them so that you get many millions of
themselves after kicked out of skin cells after it
for weeks or so
now one of that
new
technology is that's evolving
they were in a talk about
it is in the last half of the course
king cells that have been property aided in this way outside the body
and
encouraging them
form new tissues
and this is one example of that this is actually artificial skin
it's in this pete free dish here is that then membrane it's a polymer scalpel
and on that polymer scalp fold out scientists have placed
some skin cells
annette allowed it to grow
energy maintain it in the right way this polymers gal fold together with the skin self will grow into scan
and you can use this
tissue engineered
again
to treat a patient who said severe burns for example
or i diabetic whose developed all sir is that won't heal
and so this is an example of a technology that's just emerging now it's
heidi you in your lifetime
and will talk about how it works and what the what the a
beta the art is there
this ad
device
held
here is really
native namely plastic
in a little bit of metal
foley implant double
artificial heart
and it was introduced
about that
seven or eight years ago now was implanted into the first to a patient that a gentleman in kentucky and he stayed alive for
a purine of time
i with this device replacing his heart
and a development of an artificial heart again another
example of biomedical engineering
is something that
a levin trying to accomplish for decades now
and this is the closest cobb that we've book
i'm
and there are many advantages of this particular artificial heart and it's it's important
innovation and encircled the per ways
a mrna talk about this whole science of building artificial organs
a devices that are made out of totally synthetic components
to replace the function of your natural organs
in the artificial heart is a good example of them

will this town
a picture on the bottom here is
really
just a series of coloured
a dots
some are yellow summer reading some are green does it
anybody know what this is
it's an example ha but technology called the gene chip
that allows you to on each one of these spots there is dna
for example
that specific for a particular gene
in
i your um
in in your g na min the human gene them for example
and by a key bathing a small sample of fluid
patients
on the gene ship like this
or everyone of these dots
present a different gene
can see
ah by looking at the pattern of
collars on this chip
which genes are being expressed in which genes are not being x
rest in that particular individual
so what you do at a profile
of not just the genes that you possess
what chains are actually being used
to make proteins
in that
cells that surround the fluid where this was collected
and so this has been out remarkable innovation it's another example of
biomedical engineering technology
the allows us to look at what's happening inside and individual a patient
in a totally different way than we were before
i'm looking to seek
not just what gene to carry but what chains are being used a particular times in her life
and
and this is mainly every church tool now
but there's lots of reasons to believe that this is that it change the way that
physicians practice medicine
by allowing them to diagnosed or predict what's gonna happen to you in ways that they can't
currently
acyl we'll talk about technologies like this where there ad
but what the
scientific basis of it is
and how they might be useful
this is an airplane
what is that have to do with biomedical engineering
well if you could stretch and say that stated example of
engineering
to improve
human help is getting them from one place to another
ah but that would
be more to stretch that i'm going to make
ab it turns out that technologies like airplanes which word developed in the last century have become inter go parts of medicine
ah for example
are you all know that some the only treatment for some diseases is to get an organ
plant
so a kidney transplant or a liver transplant
is the only
of life extending
high intervention that can be done for some kinds of diseases
and
transplants
choir donors
a and a donor organ
is usually not at the same physical location
that
a the recipient is
and so
jack's like this one
have become very important in connecting donors to recipients
chain of surgeons is working to harvest an organic one site one other team of surgeons
is working to prepare
the recipient of another site
and the organ is flown
there now why does that happen because yet to get your gun from one place to another fast
right
the organ has to get from one place to another
very rapidly in this is the fastest way to do it
or what if we could develop ways using engineering techniques to the expand the life of an organ
so it didn't happen get where went so quickly
then that would open up
lots of more possibilities for organ transplant patient that are known now
or what if we could figure out ways to avoid organ transportation entirely
we could just take a few cells from that donor organ
ship them to the site growing new organ of the site and any planted there
and these are examples of
biomedical engineering of the future
the expand on what we currently use which involves
to know small x
dent
knowledge in like this
ah
i would guess that probably thirty to fifty percent of you do this every day
i do put a piece of
plastic a synthetic piece of plastic into your on a
i that to improve your vision
and contact lens that technology has
change dramatically from the time that i was born to the
to to the time that you were born and the
contact lenses use today are much different than the ones that would a been used thirty years ago
and that this is biomedical engineering as well
engineers were developing new materials materials that can be if you think about it
there's not very many things that you would wanna putting your eyes
and even feel comfortable putting into your eyes
so this is a very safe a very a nerd
a material what gives it those properties
what makes it
so save to put in one of the most sensitive
places in your body
in contact with your eyes
why do you have confidence
putting it in contact with one of the most important
organs of your body
ah because you trust
biomedical engineers
i to have done a good job in designing of these things in will talk about
how a bio materials are designed and tested
and what makes a material
properties were material that you could use as a contact lens what are the what of the properties that he needs to have

i'm that this is the are an example of an artificial
yep
we've learned a lot about
panic said how humans work as
a as organisms
over the last hundred years yourself how we work deserted physical objects that have to obey the laws of physics that you know about
we live in a gravitational field and that it affects our dated a life
and if you have a paying or a hip that's diseased in some way
out and you can't stand up against that gravitational field in the same way that severely limits
what you can do
in the world
and so biomedical engineers have been working for many years on how to decide replacement parts
for
caught
for ad joints
like the yep
and the artificial hit is the most well developed of those will talk about this in some detail
and you can imagine that there'd that there are many requirements that a device like this has been may
as to meet in order for it to be a good artificial
and we'll talk about those
and how the design of these has changed over the years and what we can expect in the future
and last lee up here
is a picture about bob a much smaller device this is actually an artificial heart valve
that is made of
plastics and metal
can replace
the valve inside your heart
and bombed
value or disease is not uncommon in the world
i will will talk about that little bit
we'll talk about how your normal
valves function inside your heart high your heart couldn't work in the way that it did
it didn't have valves that work
doing a very complex operation many many times a day
a and had them will talk about howl
you can build something to replace
a complicated
small part in the body like that
let's take that as step back
for a minute
that's sort of one way of looking a biomedical engineering by looking at sword of the things they you know about
but it than the result of the work of biomedical engineers and talk more generally
so what is engineering
what do engineers do
what makes engineering
different
other fields of study what makes it unique so that we have a school of engineering
at yale butts
separate from
science in the humanity its
any thoughts
much more hands on me and idiot you're actually
a in the
in there doing bangs i and many the things i showed you were things that were built
right that were but were built from a parts of that to bets a good
chin
what makes it differ from science
science can be hands on might be down at the
wake no
well g in studying them
a become hands on
but what's different
what would make you an engineer

it is all i'm so scientists
observing try to describe any engineers try design they take those descriptions and that's lipids known and they try to design new things
and so to look at a dictionary it has words like this
but your designing bangs or another witness a that is the or try to apply science
you're looking at applications
so we're trying to take scientific information
and make something new
and the other thing about it is that you could make lots of things that are new but generally you think of engineers is making things that are not just new but there useful
they do something that needs to be done
aq and that they do something that improves of life
right the quality of life of a people
and so here is a ab briefed and
god
very biased
history of engineering it short
ah by bounty
engineering became a disciplined
at about the the middle of the eighteen hundreds
lots of university started teaching engineering as a discipline including vale
in eighteen fifty two around that time
ah this might've been the first course that was offered in engineering in the country was taught at yale
in athens in civil engineering
in eighteen fifty two in anything else students don't know
that's what along distinguished history of engineering that there
their own
to shun has
first ph d. degree in engineering was awarded to a fellow named j. willard gibbs
at yale in eighteen sixty three
he says he didn't how peers
worker
and i forget exactly what the detail seventy heard of gibbs
his name that
rings a bell
we're to hear about
from
sorry
yet she
gibbs free energy
i that annoying concepts that you had to try to master in a chemistry at some point but but gibbs is really the
father of love of
a modern physical chemistry
a and
and got was one of the most
to come
that was being the scientists
of that nineteenth century in got the first ph the indian hear it at yale
and then from the is beginnings
i engineers at transformed wife in the twenty is that century
cell a lot of things started in the twentieth century became commonplace things like a lecture city have an oh occurs of the
delivered to your home jihad them ways to generate electricity into carried from point to point
i was engineers that did that
bridges and roads and we couldn't and automobiles and i and so we can get from one place to another relatively quickly
cause of that because their error
planes that were also developed
a by a engineers that century
in next century
about weak divert cited lot of new materials that could be used to build things the couldn't a been done otherwise
things like steel
polymers or plastics and ceramic sta
and
course computers
which has progressed remarkably due to the work of engineers in your lifetime till now
i you can carry around a a cell phone which would've been and think of all
even even thirty years ago
so i engineers in the twentieth century a
transformed our society
well yet things that happen during the twentieth century is that human life expected c increase dramatically
people started living a lot longer
as a what i plot on this graph here
is is a function of time years
dates
out light expected c is a function of time
and bound
what the idea you'll see here is that about
for the period before
sort of seventeen hundred
or so
human like expecting c was less than forty years of age so that means a person i was born in that year
to live on average about forty years
that was the expected like span
and they expected life's bands increase dramatically
in the last
a hundred years till now
people that were born when you were born you can expect to live
he ab
your soul a doubling in life span
fairly dramatic
so what's responsible for that
why are people living longer
than they did just a few hundred years ago
well as a clue
here on the slide
might i indicated a couple of points here
where free looked in the years sixteen sixty five and one then
you could ask the question
another way to ask a question why are people living so long as they asked the question why do people die
and in sixty sixty five ninety three percent of the people that died in that year died of infectious diseases
not it on being contrast if you look at the u. s. the
ten years ago in nineteen ninety seven for example
then people still died
but they didn't die for commonly from infectious diseases
they died from other than only four percent died from infectious diseases
so when other reasons there's and huge increase in life span is because people are dying of things that they would have
in prior years
so why the change in
why the change
in infectious diseases
why that focus on that one what makes it
so much better
to be alive now
terms of your likelihood to dive an infectious disease than it did and wanton sixteen sixty five
yes i have a lot specifically
drugs like
antibiotics
and acyl in a refer my son again something else you probably all had experience with the that well that's
biomedical engineering that's
that science that's that
somebody discovering a molecule that kills mike organisms
and that's true it is science
but
in order for that to go from being a science that works a laboratory ring one hospital
to being
and acyl in which could be used all over the world the gotta be able to make it in tremendously large
quantities
and that's the work of biomedical engineers
joining in the kite a quantities that you need
solute had those could be available for everyone in the world that they got infected
and to make it not just in abundance but make it cheap way enough that everyone could afford it
right
so
can make up a hundred times of the dry because a hundred thousand dollars a
graham
that might not be a useful dry because nobody could afford to use it
read it so it's the work of biomedical in here is really
take these innovation since science like drugs and make them
useful
them so that everybody can take advantage of it
any also mention vaccines a murder talk a lot in the middle part of the course about vaccines in the engineering of immunity
had you engineer what happens in army and system
in order to protect us from diseases
and how does another example of an area where biomedical engineers have made a tremendous contributions
so just did go a little bit further out with that
white
if you look at the cause of death in london in sixteen sixty five here's a list that i a
that i a ab
from a a from a source that was written at that time
and bombed
i don't even understand what some of these things are
the ones in green
are are infectious diseases their infectious causes a disease
outs spotted fever and per polls
about which we call a results
was ad
with a significant cause of death as was the play
right
a which we'll
have any more
goodness
tom but people died at typically up either infectious diseases
or they die during child birth
or they might indicted old age which would've been a fifty or cell
at a time
in contrast today because we have at about a son
chains people don't die
of infectious diseases and softened
they live much longer lives
they live
i to die of something else
and that leading causes of death
bob
currently haven't changed very much since nineteen ninety seven when this data was published
but they die of heart disease
cancer primarily those of the number one into causes of death
we're in a talk a lot about how
i'll one can use the technology that we have now to treat these kinds of diseases
i like cancer and heart disease
but why do you think these are the number one into
now
on these have risen
above infectious diseases
over the
over the last several hundred years
why is cancer
one of the leading killers in the u. s. novel wasn't even on the charts
in sixteen sixty five
so could be that than that that dead
that which a name
so done suggests is that it could be new things that are around
an your expose a stop the word exposed to before and that's true are environment has changed
the world is become industrialized
fred were exposed to things that might cause cancer where we were exposed to them before
and so on
and so that might be reason
yeah and sixty sixty five they were diagnosed in cancer right with these itself summary at an infectious disease
ah but you might not unknown they had aq cancer that time and they just died and we didn't have the same methods of diagnosis
that we do now so maybe it was just not diagnosed than

people are living longer and so now they have more opportunity to get cancer right the longer you live
of the more opportunity have to acquire
a disease like
sir which often isn't accumulated shun
of of
of
a
occur over a long
a period of time
disorder to talk about about cancer for example
group
what are some of the causes of cancer in the environment around is not we protect yourselves from it
and will talk about treatments
well
cardio vascular disease
why
why is cardio vascular disease
obesity or
the generally are di acts are different than they were in sixteen sixty five
while we eat different kinds of things in many people think that that's
repeated to
to
ah to much more heart disease
could also be that it was an is easily diagnosed that
so
we're dying of old age and i was really hard disease that was
killing them the does didn't know
i'm
so there is
it's a it's a mol to effect rail
about that
that is what is ch a this last
graph for this last
set of statistics
to go from
causes of death in the u. s.
to cause of death in the world
to illustrate that what happens in the world around us in the u. s. isn't s
fairly this
in other places infectious diseases a much bigger part of their life
and a much much greater risk of death from a pictures diseases in pure acidic diseases
if you live in places other than the u. s. or western europe
for example
and so
problem of infectious disease
prevention and treatment isn't salt
you know that
and so there's
by the of room to still in of a in that way to develop new methods
diseases
on not like aids
or diseases like malaria
that god that we don't have
problems with here but they do in many parts of the world
so we'll talk about that
i mentioned out that the book for the course
a and out the book is a book that that that i've written is not published yet and so i'm gonna put chapters from the book
i that irv
in a fairly final foreman i think you'll find them easy to read
of a new affected by it
affinity posted on the internet at all post chapters of that advance of the readings
and if you look on of the classes server you sought chapter one
and chapter one describe some of the
organisation of biomedical engineering into into sobbed as a plans
which i'd listed here
and so where did
talk about
king about the body as a ad
as a as a system
as a system that can be understood the same way a motor to be understood or computer the be understood
and that
daddy is systems physiology
and that's a important
some division of biomedical engineering
will talk about instrument cation a little bit and i've mentioned this things like that e k g machine and a heart lung machine
for months
that are designed to
either keep
patients alive
or to allow you to on
allow you to ion
was what i thought

or hco or allow you to a to monitor
ch in over time
imaging which i mentioned while mechanics of the study of
of of
humans is the chemical objects
we'll talk about a field which is growing out called bio molecular engineering
and that is
is the design of bio materials are new materials that can be implants in the body
new ways of drug delivery
hold
field of tissue engineering that i mentioned earlier
about artificial organs
talk about systems biology
or at thinking about how do acquiring permission to things like gene chips
and use that information to understand what's happening in a complex organism
like you
i've i've highlighted three days in blue here
imaging mechanics in by a molecular engineering
because if you go on the study
biomedical engineering purine yale anyway
these are that things that you might
he aq
to emphasize on these the things that we do best and what we have advanced
available
in these three categories a song to emphasize these three
but will talk about all of these subjects as we go through the corps
the services posted on line i've just got copied it here c to take a look
added
last a week one we're and
what is biomedical engineering
other some chapters here
for reading chapters one two and
or eyelids
i've only posted chapter one which basically reviews the things i talk about today
actors two and four
i really reviews of things the probably already know something about
to the reviews a basic chemistry
concepts
that are important thrust all
understand as we move forward
and review of palm
of proteins
and biochemistry
basically
some that a post those on line
and and we're not gonna talk about them directly in the lectures
but that there's a resort soap
you read about something like ph and you've forgotten what ph is
you can go back to chapter two which is posted in and read about ph and i tried it take you through sir of what you need to know
in order to understand the rest of the course material
and he forgot about proteins and what they're structure is like in good chapter foreign read
to give up a brief review of
biochemistry
i mean
in the section this week i'll talk about the section meetings in just a moment
there's no
acquired section meeting this week
during the section times are be available
if you feel like you water read chapters to informant common ask
corey all
on these topics of chemistry in biochemistry
our than all the available to talk about that during that time
we'll start with weak to talk imaginary engineering
what's dna how could it be manipulated
how is our ability the
to manipulate dna lead to things like gene therapy
and now be done in people
and so will talk about that or that's what chapter three is about
i'll talk about cell culture engineering during a week
for body maintains cells in culture where the limits of this happened use cultures cells to do
fangs
and out of engineers behold
new things out of culture of cells is gonna be a subject we talk about throughout the rest of the course
chapter is
here
that's enough you can follow are one with the soul of a son see sir what the topics are each week
the reading a sign that is to do before the lecture
i in order to get the most out of the lecture
now i
we'll a section meeting required section there all all the sections meet on thursday afternoon
and the idea of the thoughts
why on some subject we talked about during the week
and we do this and a the and a graduate biomedical engineering laboratory in the malone building
so that we can do demonstrations answered of hands on a projects
to relate to little bit deeper into the subject
that we're considering
and so in the first week we we run a section called from strawberries to gene therapy
talk about dna
track dna
play with the dna of a of an organism
and again think about how to use dna for other purposes
in weak three you'll actually do some cell culture in a laboratory and look at culture it cells and learn how to
manipulate
to manipulation son cells in culture
and so on throughout the weeks
we have a one hour that section it's designed to give you some more detail links
period some hands on experience with
some of the topics we're talking about
there are no lab reports
that or do
they sometimes will be homework assignments which sort of build on what we've done during the section
ah but it's not a lab in that sense that it's a long experience in the afternoon or that rick
wires in the detail ab reports
ah but it is a required and i think an important part of that course
there's a mid term exam halfway through in a final exams at the end
and there's a term paper
do near the end of the courts
so this just got to say a little bit more about the sections there's
three sections we have on line
a
passion section signed up as anybody try to do that
yeah
so they know that it's available
so's was to be available from day one you can cyprus section that fits your schedule needs this is sort of the list of things that will go through in the section beatings
gradient
ah thirty percent
of the grady is per the mid term thirty percent
for that final
and so the final is not to know it of the final covers only things for the last half of the court so it's really just like a
a a a that
covers half the course bits given during the final exam period
there's a term paper which all talk more about is the weeks
aligned its also work
so the grade
and the weekly
slowly weekly homework assignments that are that are hum
grade
ah but they have an impact be on the ten percent because of the can do the homework in the understand a homework and have no problem with the exams
a so so encouraged to spend more time than their
waiting would suggest
so how'd a given any
it's a in a course it's very simple
ah due out to do the reading before class
km the class
and you do the homework
and i guarantee if you do those
three things
throughout the course
other you'll do well in the course and and i'd i'd said this almost every time a given a course a nobody's ever told me that i'm wrong
and so do these three things you don't get in a than can come back and talking about it later
eileen
the assignment for of the next class is a due problem to of chapter one which i repeated right here
so
and that's to think beyond that i've talked about in terms of what is biomedical engineering
i to think a little bit more about biomedical engineering projects that you've encountered in your life for the awesome experience with
and then to think beyond what
formation i've given you in the chapter in this lecture
to say what products of biomedical engineering due mixed
the act
to become routine in the next
five years
to spend
ten or fifteen minutes thinking about this and and write it down or bring europe
responses to class
in the next period will talk about that
and i've
so
the end
you're this first
a lecture rag on some way in trying to tell you what
biomedical engineering is about i thought it
credit
related in a different that sort of way
and yet you've you for this
this
paul
london bridges
falling down
everybody's for this palm
play the game
i don't others video games now people play games like this where london bridge is falling down but
by this a picture of one in bridges an interesting a bridge which is important in the history of london
when deception
rev up me of really changed our society
allowed us to get from one place to another
in ways that we couldn't have gotten to up the easily before
one or the interesting things about london bridge is that it's now no longer in london
i is in arizona you can see a palm tree
here but when they when they ray constructed london bridge the movie old london bridge to arizona
some guy
bought it
that that must be interesting story but
tommy
but i just
kevin here
heidi and i think good that the plan tells you something about
engineering
through the out
and the problems of engineering
and in bridge building or well advanced
in understanding
what are the problems with building bridges and how do we overcome them
for example
one thing that could happen is that you build it up with wooden clay
the wrong material
for a bridge
any of it will
but not stand up to the forces of nature
right it will wash away
as c. gotta pick the right materials in order to build a bridge
i so you pick a better material like irons
he'll
that makes a better bridge we know that now because we haven't
various with bridges
ah but still you're bridge might fail
you might the oprah different regions
they might and involve
that is
forces of nature
like the movement of the river that's not bits knocking the bridge down but it's just the failure of these materials over time
i that they don't last as long as they might
acid a bill that with that with that
carol like silver and gold
and then you encounter the problems of society
right that you're bridge might get stolen because somebody thinks they have a better used
spring gold than your
bridge
and i would say that in biomedical engineering largely
we're we're still at the stage where we're trying to understand
things work and how they fail and what materials are the right ones
nmr maybe where
civil engineering and bridge building was
a hundred years ago
and that makes it for me a very exciting time to study this because the problems aren't solved
in the way that bridge building is largely
a solved a problem now
problems like the artificial heart ours
till
and saul
still room for innovation
still room to learn from what has it worked before
to learn from science
design something better
as a one of by a
does of this courses to get you
with the study biomedical injuring after this or not
excited about this subject
i so the you start thinking about how you
good
in of a in this area where lots of problems are still left us all
so also you on
thursday
