summary
linear polymers of amino acids are polypeptide chains a protein can be composed of one or more polypeptide chains
there are different amino acids each with its unique chemical properties conferred by the side chain the amino acids can be placed into broad categories polar nonpolar acidic and basic
there are four levels of structure for proteins the amino acid sequence is the primary structure the local domains are the secondary structure the overall three dimensional shape is the tertiary structure and the formation of a complex with other polypeptide chains is the quaternary structure
all the information necessary for a protein to fold properly into its tertiary structure is contained in the primary amino acid sequence
non covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding or the hydrophobic hydrophilic forces hold a protein in its native form covalent disulfide bonds can be formed between two cysteine amino acids located at different regions of the polypeptide chain
the three dimensional protein structure can be determined experimentally using nmr spectroscopy or x ray crystallography
proteins are often modified after translation by the addition of chemical groups to certain amino acids
