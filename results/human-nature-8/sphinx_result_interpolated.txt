so why don't you talk about
iii today's lecture
ears
i asked ran the in the philosophical tradition
that books not act the way in which
human endure connected yes
can provide
meaning and the possibility for flourishing
but what's looks rather a cactus
sort
love
the logical detachment
ask away a
dealing with a
the inevitable
shoots
all lived its
barry its
and
there is to take a nation of all the outlook that will be considering today
in the context
the western tradition
can be found in the writings
all the philosopher
here is all wonderful
imaginary portrayed on him
from seventeen fifty
who
setting added table
ce monthly with he's
paying
to use to walk
salt
his name
as you don't found the reading guide
epictetus
lived ad
the beginning called
to millennium go he made latin the from
if key
to one thirty in the common ella he was born it mean
greek speaking
asia minor
and
was that spent life living ii vote roman empire during that era
only portion all his life has
slave
here's some decide as to whether
tell the age of
team
or until the age of twenty seven biting indicates a significant portion of iv wife
with spent
beans
bravery
bottom actually gained three benefits
o. point
either before or after gaining freedom
he started
bill works
and
philosophical outlook
all the tradition
known
ads
so is says
and the works that were produced
aw and see if the happen http survive
are to
the first is a major of
for volume
collection
ah but he's discussion couple range of topics
questions ii medicaid thinks the way that
questions about the way the world is questions indicates the mala th
how does should understand world
and also questions in ethics
and edition to back
i survived beats
to ordinary bulk
that we read for today
the little
forty five happened rack
essay
known as
the handbook
which was
so there's that ill
drooping recorded by one of epictetus us
students
preserved
you got wet
now noble and that epictetus produced in the context of the handbook
was enormously influential for most of the two thousand years
back to highs
being part of the western tradition
you to a killer this
let us
he's
that i used to show you a picture i act
easy drawn pp
from
the library
ah
not not there
benjamin
adams
the second president of the units
who happiness book
iii he is
collecting
iii
eighty's
seventeen fifty
hello
latin
edition
wait till their eclipse
i'm not are you think
you to know historically about
the volume that were reading
first don't translation operate
what in fact
don by
oh great
eighteenth century woman of letters
a lifted if carter
the the translation that we are reading he is
a more modern
versions of that
so uh yeah this work epictetus
john many called book
connects
ah
doses
so we think introduced in this class go far
first to the writings
all played all
who he is a systematic philosopher in his views about everything
and his commitments are to a certain kind of
rational list formal its
idea list philosophy
and we've been introduced
to the works
style aristotle
to rule one
ah please
writings
the
to mccain ethics
oh ii bonus
to tradition the time tradition in the rustic jillian tradition
ancient philosophical world produced
i not all other ce
to mac
how books that had views about
almost
any question you could acts
among those was the v you know ads
stoics says
so ce oats how old
we've missed
you
underlying medical facts
about reality
don't move to
he itself
he is but
organic
physical to a talented
that's and governed by what they called locals
work divided he said
there he is
on order
to
the world
that activists i believe on human beings
given that
he is tomb
called today
you look kind all
virtue on this don't picture
e. s.
act think nina a pool are a
we've what resume tells you
nature good man
eat ghali not a long wait
pace
grand scheme of things
i'm not trying
fight against
what is
free divine
for
you
so it's your to prior thing that
elements
all pp the stoic tradition
get haidt ah
being subsequent
do you think
traditions
in some ways the stoic of you
that the world is all well ordered and take
governor by divine reasons
live act a hard
all
maybe
all
the religious traditions that are familiar to you today
the question then becomes what he is demanded of your perspective what sure to you do
give these to things are the case
and what us stoics suggest is that you need to its
that
he is the consequences
ah but powered and goodness of the logo ce even though the week in which it is good for you maybe
on available to you
c.
i am back in order to do so you need to moderate or desirous
you need to avoid acts
emotion
and verified
come to act
the in the accord with music
so the contemporary you said that terms
stoic one who
that aches
press offering in the face of paying
he not
on this
and of these pp
i think it'd to recognize that
how can we
all of the philosophers that we reading a
this is part of systematic world view
the ag is not need to a little bit here and a little bit there
and we don't worry about pp
yeah see if they haven't
idea about the nature
fundamental nature of reality
of you about how we know that
and then views about what we ought to do as a consequence
now i see this
he in the handbook
is concerned
only with a small portion all the stoic pitcher
he's concert
basically
when writing
the very first
self
manual
he's trying to tell you
mr warming they is
as saying
all of
ancient
roman world in about
the year
what true joan if you would like
and here is what tells you you need to do
you need to line a how to was
on appropriately to experience
i doing three things
you need to alter your purse axes
of the world so that you come human apprehended things in such a way
they don't
influence you
harmful week
we need to altered or desirous
with respect
to the world
hey unique
chance
clap sure you war life
in such a way
she's staying august
free and now
need to ce tractor socially issues
in ways that will help you
thing
a commitment
i don't next strike a minute
how can you read
rumor the tax
how
i suggested ways all bloody each of this
it is
ah the bulk
into one of these categories
so for example when epictetus
how class
that we need to alter our perception of the world
there's that we specific waves that he thinks we might
go about doing it
contents
to this
instruction
the first is that we need to pp
i really classified things
each you categories
things over which we have control
more about that in a moment
i'm things over which
don't have control
so we need to jacked our tax
china needs
down
we need also
anticipate
no we're the world's
please unfold ce
so we do not don't you know what in fact one what is that tell us
but i'm not things that aren't up to us
we need says structured our expectations in such a weight
that we are emotionally prepared
for what will befalls
and again
more about that in the couples
right
yet we need to recognize
in some ways this is a some point of the first
the wall back
judgments
police
why a
we do turn the name
whether iv he is the case
that experiences
a fax
so those are three things that epictetus says we need to
do with wrists
get out of examples of
are
each of them in a moment
edition would like to us
thing that we need to
he don't we need to carlton make appropriate
drives
need to get are desiring lined up with the world in such a way that we are its
operation
i know we need you this
he is by converting
standard relation
queen desire
and the world
usually a
desirous
graf
a way things
aunt
lecture wish they were
i desiring for only yesterday
but they're not be
the snow day in three weeks
for my children
but the world refused
cooperate
on back
question
hackett if that they just did my desires
the world
i desiring that things go want exactly as well those
good
then i would have the a
contents
make their presence
in my office
this i think that epic
hume
he in
tragic to i think
do you says it's
to ordinary feeling capacity
to a silly things from one categories
things pp
from
another
so now i showed you
the way ce in selection task
anything we tag
i
a and a half
and of four and a sad end
and a half which cardinal had to turn over to
truly whether it was true
that isn't a on one side
there's a seven on the other
doin' that
half
was
part
what wish you to vanity structure only identical to another task
attack
of being shown for cards
which had each is
alcoholic or non alcoholic drinks
and a after which cards you need
turnover
to verify true that if somebody ease drinking a beer
then she is over twenty won
all three were able to i'm nervous then
the difficult problem
you like all the problem with respect to which you had
i see it is points not to was that we have
don't sack
for letting go
we have a skill sacked
for
the logical
we haven't fitted for think
stop happens
any document
i'm what he said yes we do when the dental give an example of this
to learn not to us
certainly
the finger which we find
part to let the wealth
to the things which we find it easy
collect a lot
and there i text
floyd his capacity that we have
for metaphor it
understanding
certainly in this category epictetus concepts in pp
ah habitually be near soft
the indebted ability
all the loss
here's some bad news for all of you
you world
when to die
shall we take in happening prior
course about this
about coming to terms
we it these inevitable fact about human existence
but epictetus sid don't
why
i own is on board
profoundly
in a way that the facts
see you
not just
the lab love
the able to utter the words
i will die some day
but the level of we lead
habitually eating it
to you or relations to things
oh awesome own
things that seemed incredible lead
important
move
last of
for the
i think he did points out the importance
few points
you were
in ways that mind pp
can the norm is your culture
you what some you might have nature pointed yet
nay keep its social feedback
somehow creature active traffickers
describes the importance
all the resisting social pressure
when people say are you
you are seeking honoring gloria you must be a loser
epictetus senate
lap and face now
they're not what they say
about two
and at that point acts
here
they are almost gifts
mean packages that
five
john to
really
bce give you a kind a trick
don't a that wants you to call to the
most to be
kind of silent
able say stop and you just
calmly
the respond
sell this
strategy
that he's presenting to ask
to remain parts
am i doing the next
all black tourist to run through some ce
examples
obvious
looking first act epictetus is tax
according a direct link
and then
yeah things some contemporary and alarms
the white these that epictetus is talking about
so they don't paragraph
ah that the key pieces handbook
he is one of the most
they missed
all philosophical writing
in the western tradition of the last two thousand years to begin sense olive
something interact to laugh
some things are not act
last
are up do your accept hence
and are impulse is
our desires our versions
in short what every these are only doing
i'm not are not up to
last
betty is though that the coal
gods nor are can
it is
our reputation as our public office the is
whatever it is not our own doing
now this canada lining points out
a mistake you can make
the finn otto asa wright nature of
read a and hundred and i mean bce
he did where is the things that are not apt
wise
and that means blade
he angered and not parking
what do you think that things that are naturally in slate
that are not up
see you
oh no your own if you think think naturally in slater of
free
would that things that are not your food are you who
you will be
from what it
miserable
up sack
and walking round leaving the world for everything that
going wrong with
the midst think ah
do you think
that over which you hackett troll
and that over which you lack
cool
needs to
what did he
upset
miserable
leading us
i cooked craft keeping these categories
late
brings the greatest
cries
if you think that only one using words isn't works
annette what is not your ponies not your own
i
no one will ever call worse you
no one will ever him variable blame no one you will what not
hughes anyone
you do not us
single thing and willingly it
because it oh things over which use
i happen to fall
what are the things over which
you actually don't have control
i never consequences no one can course you
because you're only concerned about the things that are opt
see you
no one can hear you
b casa nobody can get in the way at all the things that are
now
do you
who has experience with
a frannie
or relative
when acquaintance
who has taken part being
one that bald
the many
contemporary virtues
epictetus
in the for modest out
progress
knows that at the hard love the contemporary it
well stacked
why if
a version all this epic
what
what to elite incurred more most likely
first
i run would need
and that is
as a renegade prayer
which you can find
decorated
humming birds
and
yeah fidel ce god grant me the serenity to accept the things i can act
changed
courage to change the things that happen
and wisdom
to know the difference
if morning glorious archer style you can find it decorated it
dole
or and angel
or a young child
you can find it
on a bowl
poor most striking we
you can find the
how can be
plenty of are are
for your style
or your side
still
do you marries
think he in yet
next leaks tomb the contemporary
mind
i think ce to mccain own way
that when i good and will indicates
for serenity prayer
i've found
how does and thousands of images like this
he in any language you can
think up
so this i don't that we need to does
think wish
between things that we can change in things that we can act
and that and that's one of its
we're think habits human although effort
is what's appropriate towards things that we can
he is a latin that hackett
he gets
has
offered
to
the western tradition
second example epictetus how class
a body mean what is
ah a motion regulation
the room
anticipating what we yell
and cgsc
to you
in a particular set
so he sat
oh you are going to gold
tomb
the bats
when you are not i some sort of action seven that yourself what sort of activities
it'd take a bath
oh you're mine
what happened to have
left their people and john fool
there people were in some think
don't v airport
what
benefit bleeding along line
parrot for the fact judas
reading they are needing to wait for your take it
you can a jock
the work emotion
so natal
to yourself
what to take a back
i wanna go to the airport
i want to walk across the
someone please
i c ce i bought
oh i wanted you shall be in a way that
as much once is enough upward
do you appropriately expect things to be
they are
then you will not be
drastic
i wanna walk across campus
then i sci day
i'm real mind that came walking across campus on an icy day
i'll need
kings lived my feet
rather than with them
that we each had pp
previously been on under worry it's
i ce to be
fact about the world
which he is
not up
to me
i don't quite believe it
something which does not
herb
mind
feeling called
call
very faint epictetus suggests
do you
you see to what guys
that what he is
think you os
i'm not
things that happened a
but not them
our judgments
about those things
i knew hoa when i showed you that image from the metropolitan museum
ah socrates dat
upon drinking the handbook
and to fooled you
that
ah yeah
john with nobility
recording why a good key a party to it
something true a list of socrates
and
of
carpenter bce
from nasa right
you section he says
one can third eye
all
how bce don't
for people's thoughts
about how to deal we a
human life
and it's indebted abilities
so epictetus search what think people are not things but the judgments about those things for example
yeah pp
mean it's not the senate
my could be nothing dreadful
poor even word dreadful then socrates
the great wise one
what a hacked out to to be dreadful
what ask don't about jack
not decades
sal
what is a dreadful about dad
ease the judge made
about
yeah pp
that the please
dreadful
nothing you
he is
harmful mean it's
it's ah true you leather united
harm
when you teach your children not to be ops
why
bill thought list wants
ah there classmates
what you'd have to vanity is
what a classmates
say about them
them
i laugh
it's emotionally disturbed ii
shoot don't
if you don't whacked it hurt you
you to richie
i'm can find morrison given to this
for the would be a
playing hamlet
even famous rosen trance and gilded mr
scene
ah
hamlet
check could actually therefore you because a nurse and there's
hamlet
happening in one of the colleges
you a couple of weeks
so how could even conversation with these two and a fairies
and complaining about what are rotten place
denmark
it's
i
they disagree
they set up
then not dawson strike us
as so ban
and famous elaine hamlet ce
says
back
why then do you
for the jury's not think he their would them were bad but
king makes
so
when you walked around the world
think hack shades
and sighs
miss it
cable is
rex handler
these walls are
white
the temperature is back in fact these are pp
world
but don't don't hackett bases
attached to them
not at how cgsc
to and the band
that haiti is good
war that
it is us that from it
ah be event
that gives it back
the lets
that's the third at the teaching
points
fourth point
i tedious
following for
out
that there are two liza all having
science
one can on the one hand
the world to conform to what you want
oh i think tank
as you want
conform to the world
epictetus papers
hey do not want hackett bank
you as you want them to
what if i
maud them to happen
i made you
i
you war life will go well
certainly get out
hundred percent yelling key the to get what you want
want
what you get
if you want what you get you will get
to want
still concert philosophy how as a way it called
writings
i'm one of the ways of thinking about it be use this notion of a called direct
think about what i shopping list
so because i had him cartoon left over from mac
find with the double a few weeks ago
thought i'd use it for my shopping with
so here i am on enlightened by epictetus and i right on my shopping list that and interact
hers
broccoli and when you sit
and so i go to the store and of of o. out my desire depend upon their be
apple
broccoli
and
let's
you so
enlightened by epictetus
go through this store
look and see what's there
paul latch apply to take are and make you a next
apples
broccoli and lands
so our there's no difference between else
even though your ce
vanity
was to shake your desire to fit the world
i cracked iii
what's to try to shape the world
bit by his side
but what happens to whites
when the store
helped
broccoli
i have on my nest
how whose
want to lead
an lemons
get do you know all
and sat back
frustration
you ill will
i can track and fitted so i have to don't
you want
what
what
so how
it you show nest
and everything is
fine
the act the mood
i do year
is that if you shave your desirous to
the way things to act
we are
you will never are
b
frustrated
fourth suggestions
work
one of you must be keeping can
proper perspective
so i epictetus offers this
to ordinary analogy
he in
paragraph seven
he said own voyage when your boat had banker
if you're to get
less water
you take a possum also fetch
can of next able by the way
it human keep yuan fixed on the don't
and we'll go round frequently in case attacking call
if you carl
you must what all those other things books
c will not keep
cuomo michigan like life
the i'd he is a
sure go mad
ensures that in the world
but don't let yourself be hackett tax
when i'm need your prior year comes
keep famous being a word or in your mind
what he continues think he is how wiki seem like
you not added when they to shelf wish
and
tomatoes
this is how our doesn't like to mind quoting again
if you are given a white
and each what
least don't a beds doubling a small selfish
that's should not
endure you either
what did it happen pools
let all things go and mind the bow bit
out
turning back
i was strategies that you have available for you
for do you would think this
chris trey should ce you recognize
and adopt bill was attitude towards things whose trenches
he is painful
to you
when you org job great see santa you say that it bought a broken john
when you war
child these lost
ce
that is bought a lost
china
do it
he is
the logical
consequence
ah be outlook that haidt being
presenting to you
around
he gets
it's something really good
when it was the serenity prayer
it's think pretty going to
at the grocery store
it's not is pretty disturbing
when it fell wife
and
child
what do you think
that's going
on
i leave that for you wealth a question
and turn it now works
feud
the second day
that be read
word today
oh great work
composed
he in the sixth
centuries
in around five twenty four
why have somebody who's not conjecture you blank
also
endure dudley
to the way that epictetus instead
epictetus you were called was born us
late
and try to make found
all give my things
the ruins
i'll ce offering
once he became free
boethius by contrast
was born into a noble family
was enormously successful politically in his early years
i true signs who went on to be
enormously successful political figures
i
he he s made your years
mas are
imprisoned
for
treason
an beak how consolation of philosophy was one of the most
why didn't reading reproduced
works
all eats
and i it was read for centuries and centuries by almost everyone
we have gorgeous illuminated menus
that shall wise
the story
so in this mind here is a week he is
for hank
teaching
all
and here she a is afterwards
locked up
in jail
now i do yet
jail
in prison you
wish ii is
tortured and
spring
otis can salsa
in ce
ralph
mind
engaging he in in a match america
we
figure that calls
philosophy
since you're is philosophy
come to visit boethius
being
he is
i'm what i philosophy says
you he him
he is
in many ways
like what epictetus was talking about
there he if she says
a wheel
while the
fortune
sometimes things start off badly
that that
sometimes things start off better
and get back
what do you hooking evidently
be a circle
to what comes to you
and to why please
taking
from
you
and recognizing
that very he is
nothing
to be got
other than to recognize that the if
he is the pattern that white
he is
to boethius
enormously
liberated
recognize think
that
what gold along with pp
things these the possibility of using them
alice him to come to terms
we if
b race
on having lost
all that
c.
previously hack
what i wanted do he in the final faction all the lecture
easy to return to a theme that we does
gossip
previously
question at all what philosophical utility their eased
works
during times of dicks
stream to rest
so
my hope
cause you
rag
i had
that even if you don't recognize this settlement
can guess who he is
mrs admiral james stockdale pp
who was
i.'s among other things
ah imprisoned alongside john mccain
the a and white
during the vietnam war
i was also the bike
so
candidate
running on the independent take it
understand
for
you were born
so jinx stockdale
i fixed don't you in the ink
madame removing them are that we read
stay
style think deed works all the classical tradition
he read epictetus he read by to the other acts
stoics
he read in the egg
he read the honesty
and all he's worked hard all pp
he is
cognitive and emotional record far
when he in vietnam the following things happen to him
it was september ninth nineteen sixty five
i'd reading now from his book
full at five hundred knots
right into of flack
the level in the little iv for airplane
a cockpit walls not even three feet up
hi
could this tier after it was on fire its control system shot out
after rejecting i have
thirty seconds to make my laugh
freedom
before i mended
in the main street of a little village right haidt ants
so help me out i whispered to myself
five years down here at least
i'm leaving the world of technology and entering
the world love
many pack hang
he says now quoting from the handbook
many at hand from the encourage young the handbook
i a jacket from that airplane at that intended from that airplane
la not
opening paragraph that we read a few moments ago
i'm spending that us don't
always keep
second files in his mind for a
the was things that are apprehension be
those things that are not happen him another way it's
fame defense backed out
those things that are with the any that work
and those things
that are beyond his power
to win not awaits thingy
those things that are beyond what did not things free will
and though was that lie beyond it
oh ahmed things
over which you do not have control
which being a the contacts
all tortured imprisonment
r a huge number
ah
after that
can says stockdale
it will do you to of
here and then of the i. a. b.
iv i am convict them
i need to lad
gall
ah
thought
that there was things will change
however
and this is crucial
everything in categories a ii is
up to me
in my power
in my will
and bill are so are the things that are harper the subject
from my total concerned
and involvement
need matter think food might pins might james my abrasions
mike read my join my judgments mike hackett to what does go about what's going on my cool good might own evil
my iii true character says
stockdales can circumstances
which are almost unimaginable ii difficult
my character and my wrist
bond
to those things
are
to
need
i he goes oh oh to describe b x
ce periods
oh
torture
you saying
ah true up
that we've seen repeatedly in the text
read
he said s
when tortured
what we actually get what and least from the torture what we contemplated
was
that we had indeed she in a certain sort all that
frail all pp ourselves them always
it was vietnam earned whites
stoic cart
act most of the moral harm that we talked about
when we discussed the jonathan she work
a shoulder broken a bone in my backdrop into a leg broken twice work
she heights
in comparison
hackett tedious
look i'm not for any great up time than this
drawing the trustworthy
self respect in
well be haidt marin the u. ce
citing
sid you a chance of extravagant
that forced people
to discovered south africa
all what they are capable that they don't wish
c.
are what is
most
harmful
whites i don't ce yes
it will do no good to being told by ce
selling points
late in your daughter
why then getting cold by selling rinse waving your soul
he's expressing the thought
to year
to you
when we brag he in the discussions
all pp jonathan shay
about the experience ce
ah pp
feeling
that one had betrayed
what once stood for
that he is what led to a feeling of world are
and when children some depths
found selves cute
things that they
ballot
what paul said
two of them
a shivered
a shock
they felt ideas order in their souls
here again is an answer to
lyle cons
challenge
but notice
that
those
stop yale eased
you on board much of the attic
he's you don't think
the bit about
to made no
and
the wife
that these
he rejects in epictetus
the idea that
social
relations
aren't
important
in a pair not how the one that i just wish it to you he writes this
follow us
when people are released from solitary confinement would put back in a regular cell block
how do you american team added that it's
