brain
this is an odd and unnatural view
maybe you don't believe it
maybe you believe in dualism

dualism
descartes

animals as reflex machines robots
we also have material bodies
but our minds are immaterial and nonphyscial


dualism
argument
the creativity and spontaneity of human action

dualism
argument
i think therefore i am


dualism


dualism seems right
  language
my arm my heart my body my brain


dualism seems right
  personal identity
same person after radical bodily changes


dualism seems right
  personal identity many people one body
synopsis slapstick
fantastical farce about an eccentric millionairess whose soul inhabits her male lawyer s body


dualism seems right
  the survival of the self after the destruction of the body

current view
dualism is wrong
mind   brain
  problems with dualism
  we know have a better understanding of what physical things can do
computers   robots
  strong evidence for the role of the brain


how does the brain work


neurons





about
sensory neurons motor neurons interneurons
all or nothing
intensity expressed through number of neurons
firing   frequency of firing


neurons
  communication over synapses axons release
neurotransmitters
   excitatory
   inhibitory
  drugs agonists vs antagonists
   curare
   alcohol
   amphetamines
   prozac
   l dopa

is the brain wired up like a
personal computer
no because it is highly resistant to damage extremely fast
unlike most human designed computers the brain works through massively parallel processing


what do different parts of the brain do
  you don't need your brain for everything
   sucking in newborns
   limb flexion in withdrawal from pain
   erection of the penis
   vomiting

some subcortical structures
medualla certain reflexes
heartbeat breathing
cerebeullum complicated
skilled motor
movements
hypothalamus hunger
thirst sleep


less than     of the human
cortex contains projection areas the rest is involved with
language reasoning moral
thought etc

some very bad things that could happen to you and your brain
  apraxia
  agnosia
   visual agnosia
   prosopagnosia

  sensory neglect
  aphasia
  acquired psychopathy


how many minds do you have


brain has   hemispheres
  left   right sides are separate
  corpus callosum
major pathway between hemispheres
  some functions are lateralized
language on left math music on right

  lateralization is never right hemisphere

corpus callosum

left hemisphere


sensory information sent to opposite hemisphere
left visual right visual
field
field

  principle is contralateral
organization
  sensory data crosses over in pathways leading to the cortex
  visual crossover

optic nerves

left visual field to right hemisphere
right field to left

  other senses similar
left visual corpus right visual
cortex callosum
cortex

contralateral motor control
  movements controlled by motor area
  right hemisphere controls left side of body
  left hemisphere controls right side
  motor nerves cross sides in spinal cord

motor cortex

somatosensory cortex


corpus callosum
  major but not only
medial surface of right hemisphere
pathway between sides
  connects comparable structures on each side
  permits data received on one side to be processed in both hemispheres
  aids motor coordination corpus callosum
of left and right side

a bit of humility part i
  mind as information processor as computer
  recognition language motor control logic

  but there still remains the hard problem of consciousness
  subjective experience what it s like
  qualia


how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the djin when aladdin rubbed his lamp thomas huxley

a bit of humility part ii
  mechanistic conception of mental life
  but what about humanist values
   free will and responsibility
   intrinsic value
   spiritual value
  can they be reconciled
