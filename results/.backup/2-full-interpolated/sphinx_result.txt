lieutenant against the class proper
bomb
introduction psychology
with a discussion about the brain
and take your i will lead off the class
tom
with an idea
that the nobel prize winning
biology us
francis grit
right that's
this don king hypothesis
and astonishing hypothesis
is sometimes
like this
as he writes this don king hypothesis is that view
your joyce in your sorrows your memory your ambitions your sense
pointing free will
are in fact no more than the behavior of the fast assembly of nerve cells
long
as lewis carroll salads my the phrase to
you nothing but a pack of neurons
tom
it is fair to describe this as astonishing it is an aunt and unnatural
and i don't actually expect people to believe that
it's northern question whether you'll believe it when this class comes when an
but i'd be surprised
it many view believe it now
most people don't
most people
hold it differently
most people
are do what was
now dualism
is a very different doctor
it's a doctor can be found
every religion
and in most philosophical systems
i throat history
it was very explicit in plato
friends that's
the most articulate
and well known offender dualism
is the philosopher rene descartes
and renee descartes calm
explicitly asked a question
our humans merely physical
machines
nearly physical things
any astronaut
he agreed that animals
our machines
in fact they call them beast machines
and said animals non human animals
or merely robots
but people are different
there's a do well of the people
like animals be possessed
very robots
but on like animals
what we are
is not physical
we
are immaterial souls
possessed
physical bought that
at have physical bodies
the reside in physical bodies
that connects
the physical bodies
on so this is known as dualism
because the claim is free humans at least are to separate fact
there's a material bodies
and as are immaterial mind
descartes rachel arguments
for dualism
one argument
ah
involved observations of of human action
so descartes live in a fairly sophisticated time
in this time to have robots
these were not electrical robots of course they were robots
our
by an eye drops
so descartes would walk around the french will guard
and a french boyle guards were set up
like a seventeenth century disneyland
they had these characters
that would operate according to water flow
and so he stepped on a certain now
a swords men would jump out of soared
could you step somewhere else
bathing beauty would cover self up
behind some bushes
and a cassette
white
these
machines respond in certain way
the certain actions
so machines
can do certain things of that is as
are bodies work that way to opie tap somebody on in the arrival
well maybe that's all we are
the descartes said that can't be
because are things a humans do
that know machines are do humans
are not limited
to reflexes action rather humans are capable of
coordinated create it's
bob
spontaneity s
we can use language fronts
and sometimes my use of language a can be reflex of some basis
how are you i said
i'm fine how are you
but sometimes
tom
i to say what i choose to they our it pretty damn good
i his shoes
but machines descartes
are incapable of that sort of choice
hence we are not near
machines
the second argument
is of course quite famous
and this was a map that this
he came to using the method of doubt
so he started asking self the question
what can i be sure of
and he said well
i believe there's a got
but honestly i can't be sure that about
i believe i live in a rich country
but maybe i didn't fool
is i i believe i've had friends and family
but maybe
i am being tricked
they be evil being and friends
has tricked
as deluded into thinking i had experiences
on
better aren't real of course the modern
version of this is the matrix
the idea to matrix is explicitly built on partition
descartes worries about people demon
maybe everything turnout
very in side
is not real
or rather as a product
some other perhaps more level
descartes similar to the deli as body is body
but he noticed a madman
sometimes believe get action
dualism
were they believe they're of different sizes and shapes and it really i
how only norm operates
i mean crazy people
don't think they're crazy some effect optic embraces in about this
i one l descartes set
i'm not dreaming right now
but there is one thing descartes concluded of the knocked up
and dancers the not the
that he is himself think
that oneself or feud
and so descartes used a method of doubt
to state
there's something really different
about having a body
best always uncertain
from having online
and he uses argument as a way to support dualism
as it
a way to support idea
bodies and minds
are separate
and so we concluded
i knew that i was a substance a whole essence are nature which is a think
and that horse existence
there's no need
of anyplace
nor does the pen and immaterial think
that is to say the soul by which i am
when i
is entirely just think
from baht
now
a settle for this is common sense and one illustrate
common sense major this
and if you wait
one thing is
our dualism is a national language
so we have a certain
motive talking about things that we all
things that are post works
my arm my heart my child my car
what we also extended to
my body my brain
talk about only your brain
as if we're somehow separate from
our dualism shows up into which he spoke personal identity
and what this means is
that
common sense tells us
that somebody can be the same person human of their body under goes radical
found changes
arm the best examples of this
our fictional
so we have no wonder no problem
understanding a movie
we're somebody goes to sleep
as a teenager
in wakes up
farmer
some all person
now
medualla release it
nobody says thought that's a documentary i believe that for a true
same time
nobody no adult know teenager no child of a thesis on to we conception we can you
rather we followed
follow
follow the story
we can also follow stories
on which involved more profound transformation
as when a man dies and is reborn
lyle
now
you might have different views around people runners for what different
so whether we information really
but we can imagine it would imagine a person
don and re emerging another body
this is not hollywood invention
when a great short stories of last century begin
by ponds pop
as greater sam's awoke one morning from uneasy beauty found self and wanton does that
and again hopped in
invites us to imagine waking up
into a body of a copper
and we can
this is also water
hundreds of years before the birth of christ
homer
describe the fate of the companions
a vote busiest
who are transformed by a wish
indicates
action is not quite right
she didn't turn amended to take it is something works
she stopped them in the bodies of cakes
they added voice in brussels and body oops
mind but there minds remained
so they were candor weeping
and we are invited to imagine the fate of again finding themselves in a bodies
of other creatures
any given a match in s this is because you arm action in white you are
s suffer
from the body
they human side
we allow for notion that many people can occupy one body
this is a main stay of some slapstick humor including classic
movie all the
steve martin lee problem highly recommended
but many people
think this sort of thing really happens
one analysis of multiple personality disorder
is that you had many people inside a single body
fighting it out for control
now we will discuss multiple personalities work
for c. n. of this mastered it turns out
things are good deal more complicated than
but still my point is an about
how it really is how we think about
common sense tells us
you could have more than one person
inside a single body
it shows up in a different context
involving action systems
we're many believe systems allow
for the idea that people's behavior
can the there people are rational behavior could be because something else
has taken over
they're bodies
finally
ah
most people around the world
or religions and most people in most countries at most times
believe
that people can survive structures there bodies
tom now cultures differ
according to the fake
of the body
some cultures happen body going to hector side of a the soul
some cultures have you going ahead than
or descending to hell
others have you occupy another body
i'm
still others have you occupy no mortars
fear world
but what they should areas the idea that we you are
inseparable from this physical free you carry around
and a physical thing
arm
they you carry around
i can be destroyed
while you live long
these views are particularly common
in united states
i'm one survey
than in chicago a few years ago
people were asked or religion
and there were asked what would happen to them when they die
most people one sample work christian
and about ninety six percent efficient set
when i die mind but have
some of the sample was jewish
and judaism
is actually religion will the west
players
story about after what
still
most of the subjects wait and of by themselves is jewish
said when they died what happened
ah some of the sample denied having any religion at all
they have no religion
at all
still
when these people were asked what would happen when they would die
most of them answered almond butter heaven

so
dualism isn't actually a lot rest on
but as prick points out
the sign to the consensus now is a dualism is wrong
there is no you
separate will are separate
from your body
indeed take your
there's no use that rubble
from your brain
to put at the way cobb and of scientists in psychologist neuro scientists like that
what it
on
the mind is what the brain does
the berta mind reflects the work things of the brain
sly complication
the working
of a computer
now why would you hold
to know rages
why would you reject dualism favor this alternate
well a few reasons
one reason as
dualism has always had problems
one think
supper family and scientific doctor
we wanna know it's curious people
how children learn language
what we find attractive or unattractive
what's the basis for mental illness
and dualism simply says
it's all nonphysical us part of the ether
and hence fails to explain
more specifically
dualism like a car
trouble to explain
how what physical body
connects to in immaterial soul
what's the conduit
how would this connection be made after all descartes knew full well
there is such a connects
e. u. your body will major commands
ah if you bang you to post a ditto you field he
to drink alcohol it affects your reasoning
but it only wave is hands
as to how this physical
thing in the world
connects
to immaterial won
descartes
when he was a lot
was reasonable enough
concluding
that physical objects
cannot do certain facts
he was reasonable love and people intrinsic as to it
there's no way of nearly physical optic double play game
because and that such a capacity is beyond capacity
of the physical world
hence you happy why
you have to extend that nation
to and immaterial soul
but now we know
we have bigfoot what scientists call in existence for
we know
physical objects
can do complicated an interesting things
we know for instance
machines can play chess
we know machines view manipulate symbols
we know machines have limited capacity stuff
to
engage in mathematical of logical reasoning
ah to recognize things
to do various forms of complication
in this makes at least
possible
that we are such machines
so one of you can no longer say what
physical things just can't do that
because we know physical think can do a lot
and this opens up the possibility
that get that humans are physical things in particular
but humans our brains
why am i
there strong evidence
that the brain is involved
in mental life
somebody will the public duel this view
palm
that said that what we do when what we decide what we think a what we want
are will have nothing to do the physical world
would be embarrassed by the fact
that the brain seems to correspond
in a trick it and then and the lab are ways
to one mental life
ah
this is than
known for a long time
philosophers a psychologist new over a long time to get a
smack in the hay
could change are mental faculties
that diseases like syphilis could make you to rain
that
chemicals like caffeine and alcohol can affect
how you think
well what's new is
we can alan different way see
the direct effects of mental life
somebody with
a severe and profound
loss of mental faculties
the deficit will be shown
corresponding wait
in are brain
ah
today's use a imaging techniques
like cat scans that
and have them on
illustrate that different parts of the brain are active
but during different parts of mental life
for instance
on
many seeing words hearing words reading words and generating
can correspond to different aspects
of what party your brain is active
to some extent
if we put you in happen minds
nana
an observer we're doing in real time
by looking at activity patterns in your brain
we can tell whether
you're thinking about music
or thinking about sex
to some extent we can tell
whether you're solving world a lot
verses something off
and this is no surprise
it what we are still working so far corpus
brent
but it is extremely difficult to it's
why
bomb
one is a dual us
now
so you have this
the scientific in senses is that
all of mental life including consciousness no motions
and choice morality
art of products of brain activity
so
you would expect that we we ripped open this
gall
and look at the brain
you'd see something cortex
you see like data
a bit shiny the move glass tubes and
blinding lights and
and sparks in
wonderful collars
and
actually though the brain just discussed that

it looks like like an old needle
it's on
it's it's gray
when you take a better that
thought gray matter
but that has because of that et
inside it is bright red cousins
paul single blot
it doesn't even is good
tom
well
any money every the brain
i mean it's going with cream sauce but everything's good
so
so it's a question then is
how could something like bets
to minds
twice
and and you have that some separate the
for poor descartes is another argument descartes could've made as a lot less
than the ones he did make which is
back then
responsible for free will and love and consciousness
ridiculous
what i wanna do and what what the goal of of neural sign
is
to make unless we did
the trial explain
how the brain
works
how the brain can give rise to thought
and what i wanted it to they stick a first baptist question
tom
but is something will continue to discuss rope of course as we talk about different aspects
of mental life
what i wanted to though now is provided big pictures i wanna do is
don off small
with the smallest
interesting part of the brain
and then get bigger and bigger and it
talk about how the small part of the brain
the neurons the basic building blocks plot
combined other mental structures
in any given sub parts of the brain
finally to the whole thing
so
one of the discoveries of psychology
is that
the basic unit of the brain
appears to be than are on
neurons specific sort of cell
under neurons has
three major parts
as you could see a listed here
neurons action look quite different from one another
this is a typical won
the road again rights
the soul temples
here
and then rights
yes signals
from other neurons
and these signals can be either
so editorial
which is that they raise the likely the dinner on
fire
or inhibitory
annette they will work
the likelihood that interim five
the self bodies sums it up
they give you an arab medically
excitatory bomb
signals are plus is
the the inhibitory windsor my mrs
and then if you get a certain number of
the or something
the novel five
fires
along axons
the think to right
that song is on
much longer than the dent right
and in fact some axons are many feet long
on there's a maxim leading from yours
final cord
your big toe
for instance
it is so shocking lights go
tom
surrounded surrounding indignantly the mechanical metaphor
but what of lead descartes to despair
poet
ah
surrounding
that song is a my lynch
which is actually does insulation
it help firing
so there's about to but neurons
there are a lot of them
about a thousand billion of them
engage neurons can be connected
to
a ramp
thousands rats tens of thousands
other
so
it's extraordinary complicated
shooting divides
neurons commence re flavors
there are sensory neurons which take information from the world
so as you see need for instance
tom there neurons firing from your read
sending signals your brain
there are motor neurons if you decide to raise your hands
those are motor neurons
telling the muscles what to do
and there are intern neurons
which connected to
and basically interneurons
you thinking
they
make the connection between sensation action
all the instantly believe
and as a sort of thing i what it might caucus course many years of what lecture
that neurons
tom do not grow back once you lose them
bomb
they never get them back this is actually
not true
there parts of the brain which in which neurons
can
we grow
one interesting thing about neurons is
and neurons like a gun
it either flyers or it doesn't
or nothing
ah
if you squeeze the trigger of a gun really hard really fast
fire any faster are are
in the displeased it
gently
mom
that is seems to beast
brain
i want how it neurons
the or nothing
when sensation
very great it
if some the next you push
on your hand
tom
the degree of pushing
you'd be able to notices not either pushing are not pushing
you been
degrees of pushing
that means if he
degrees of right
and that's rest although neurons or nothing there a wasted
both intensity
so one simple way to potent and city
is the number of neurons firing
the more
neurons more and
another way to increase intensity
is the frequency of firing
ah
so
of misuse those to the first one of the number neurons pirate
was it frequency of firing
in that something is more intense
it is
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and
bang
back
that
these are two ways
through which neurons in quote
intensity
now
neurons
art net
and they talk to one another
then they used to be thought they were tied to one another
like a computers like you take wires you connect wired
to each of the wrapping round
all
it turns of this is indicated
that neurons
relate to one another chemical it
in a kind of interesting way
sweet any neurons
swing acts on a one or
and again right of another
there's a tiny jack
the gap to be about one can balance
of the mill the meter why
the contest will get
and this gap is known as a cement
and what happens is
when are neurons wires
and axons sense
shooting through the gap
these chemicals are known as neurotransmitters
ah
and a affected and right
so neurons communicate one another
chemical it
bomb these
again
the chemicals could
excite the other wrong
excitatory
ring out the chances of will fire
or and give it the other mer
inhibitory
now
neurotransmitters
come interesting
because a long of a
psycho farm apology
bomb
both of the medical sort and a recreational sort
djin says
of giggling with narrow transfer
and so you couldn't even say this for some examples
ah
there are two sorts of ways you could fiddle with neurotransmitters
corresponding lee
to sorts of drugs
there are agonists
and when agonists thus
is the
increases the fact of nerves and smithers
either by making more are trance matters
or stopping the cleanup of neurotransmitters
or in some cases by faking inner fast
by making as a fact
then there antagonists
that slowdown in abner smithers
either because a destroyed neurotransmitters
or to make it heartbeat more
or in some cases they go to dan right under on
and again of the paced over
so the neurotransmitters can't connect
and it's through these clever way
that neurons
can affect
you're mental life
so for instance
bomb
there is a drug known as a raw are
and we're are a bomb
he is an antagonists
is a very particular sort of antagonists
it tom
it walks motor neurons
from affecting muscle fibers
with this does then is it paralyzed
because you're motor neurons
send a command
to your arm suspected philip that
it doesn't work
you say need mentor latest the to move it doesn't work
the motor neurons
our party activated
i'm
and then because
the way you breathe is motor not even die
there's alcohol
alcohol is inhibitory
now this may be puzzling does people it is my only paradox
because you maybe they be
alcohol is not inhibitory
on a conquer
when i drink a lot of alcohol
i does my in addition to become a more fun person
i become
i become more aggressive and more
sexually vibrant than simply more beautiful
and and
so
we will always alcohol inhibitory well
yes areas
it a
it in a this
the in the day inhibitory parts your brain
so you hat
parts of your brain that are basically telling you now bargain
okay
he depends on
don't hit me by the
values bad words
alcohol relax is
shuts down those parts of the brain
if you take a not alcohol it then goes down
to in vivid excitatory parts of your brain
a new fall pass a
amphetamines
increase the amount
of the radical
in particular they increased amount of northern after
i neurotransmitters as responsible for
just
general aroused
and so amphetamines include drugs likes

there are
ah
prozac work sincere tone and
when we discussed clinical psychology depression
bomb
will learn extent to which neuro transmitter disorders
are
implicated certain disorders like depression
and
one problem is
that on
for depression
is that there's too little of inner transmitter known
as syrup on
bomb
prozac
make circled in
more prevalent
and so in some extent might help the be a
depression
com park in since disease
is a disease involving
no motor are
troll a loss of motor control
the moving
on and one factor in part in senses
little of underpants cheddar
known as dopa
the drug l dopa
priest is a supplied dopa
and so does something to
a levy at least temporarily
the symptoms of our concerns
so you have neurons
under cluster together
and the fire the communicate one
so has a soul work
to give rise to creatures of the do interesting things
ha can thank
well again
it used to be believe that the brain is wired up like a computer
like a p. c. are mac or something
oh we know this can't be true
can't be true
his wrist two ways in which the brain is better than
for one thing
the brain is highly resistant to that
if you have a laptop
and i persuaded open up
for me
and i take of flyers
because the just the that anywhere
your laptop will be destroyed
but the brain is actually more brazil it
you can take a lot of brain that
and still
preserve some mental function
the some interesting sent to some sort of
damage resistance
built into the brain
that allows different parts of the brain to take over
damn
a second consideration is
the brain is extremely fast
it computer works on
wired swatches of the
we your brain
uses tissue
and tissue is extremely slow
the paradox than is
how you created a fast computer with such
will stop
and you can what if data brain was wired up with a personal computer
it would take you
four hours to recognize
but in fact we to do things extremely quickly
so the question then as
how we is the brain wired
an answer is
unlike many can bomb unlike
commercially generated computers
the brain works for parallel
processed massively parallel the street protests
there's a whole lot or research
and this is research some of which takes place outside psychology department
in in engineering department computer science department
trying to figure out
how
i computer can do the same things
brain scan to
and one white people this is
they take
can't from nature
in a product of scrap
massively distributed
networks
the do aspects of reason
there's a very simple
complication on network
that
is interestingly does it come look
the way neurons
and this is often known as neural network
and people who study this
setting
neural network model
the tribe builds more machines
by modeling them actor brain
tom
in and less twenty years
or so
this is than a huge and vibrant areas
we're people are trying to wire up machines
can do brain like things
from components
that look a lot like neurons inner wired

one
consideration all of this
is it is is a very young field and nobody knows how to do it
there is no machine yet
that can recognize faces
or understand sentences
at the level a two year old him
there's no initiate a computers of anything people who
in an interesting way
this isn't heart
because the human brain is wired up next
corner be more complicated way
than any sort of civil neural network
this is sort of ski mac diagram you not responsible
palm of on
oh parts of the visual cortex
and if they to realize about this is
is extraordinary simple
so the brain as a complicated
system
now
so we've talked a little bit
about
the basic building blocks
of the brain
neurons
on
we then talked about how neurons can communicate to one
then turned
to have neurons our own
are wired up to get
now let's talk a little bit of a different parts of
about
this some things you don't actually need your brain to do
the study of what you don't need
your brain to do
as often drawn up on this weird on
medualla g.
where does that fit and france a lot
where would the cap a people
and when after the cavity people psychologist would rush to the body
of the head was person inserted
just as the reflexes
stop as kind music
but we now up
there's something you don't need your brain
you know need your brain
bird newborns up in
i'm
live reflex asian withdraw from pain
human pull back even if your head is gone
erection of the penis can be done of other brain
vomiting
also done better but that
i hate a
i need a volunteer
a hung very simple this moment all
any of excellence
any of about
could you stand up
okay
this is a new shirts i once they awaits
now is it
if you'll hold a your hand
and one hand flat
x. x. does the textbook
petition
tom
perfect
we'll know this is
you very much
we're you know this is
this fitness and win back up
this is something automatic
instinct that
and does not require your brain
so your brain is needed for everything
what does your brain do
well some things that your brain does
involved very low level in terms
tom
these are called subcortical structures
because herbal logo cortex
your honor need the cortex
so for instance ahmad react there is
a diagram of the brain the waiter be this diagram is
it's a civil war my brain facing this way
my higgins cod
brown or
and then you could see
the brain
so this is the frost
over there
that's the that
ah some key parts are illustrated here
the mid to upper incense
is on
responsible for
heart rate restoration
is very deep within the brain
and if it gets damage that you're likely to thought
the cerebeullum
is responsible for body balance and muscular coordination
and to give you again
feeling for the complexity of the systems
this are about contains approximate thirty billion are
ah the hyper fallon s is responsible here
she they
hunger
thirst
and the some extent
sleep
and here's a same brain parts
in close

now
or lily's parts a rains are essential
many of them remotely interested
but we're the action is
is the cortex
isn't this beautiful
ah
the cortex is the outer layer
and l her layer is all crumpled up
iran wonder why your brain with wrinkles
bomb that's because the soul problems
tom if you took out somebody is cortex
an flattened the that
it view a two feet square
so what the mightily to rubbed
tom
and
the cortex
is where all the need to
takes place arm
fish don't have any of that
so no whence the fish greatness fish don't have much of a mental life
reptiles and birds have a little bit about it
prime aids
in humans have are be a lot
eighty percent of the volume of our brain
about
i'm
and the cortex
can be broken up into different parts
or locals
there is the food again this is facing
in profile court
there's a frontal lowell
easy to remember his
hard front
ah
the bridal will
people will
and the temporal
and when the no matter returned to his
this is half the brain
it's this is in fact
the left that
of the brain
on the other half the right path everything's duplicate
with some slides level
differences
what's really we're one really we're finding
about the slopes
is that include koppel logical maps
they include massacre body
ah
there's a cartoon
which actually illustrates a classic
germans
by some physiology is
who for some reason pat
at a dog's brain opened up
as certain shocking different parts of the brain
the the do brain surgery while fully conscious
brain
is self has no
organs to it
and it turns out that the dog monies that part of this brain
language pick up
annette token doctor pain field
ahmed medial university
to do the same thing with people
so you know some brain surgery
the ethel i people playing just on i don't know how to do this
is it is acting at
and role
person is
sir body wouldn't
more than that
we sat other parts of the brain
the zach other parts of the brain
people claim the air trapped
and other parts of brain
people would claim
to experience
and through his research
and other research
it was found after maps
in the brain of the body
there is a map in the motor part
motor cortex
ah but sort up on left
and a sensory cortex
of the sort
the you could see on the right
anybody would anybody tell what swat
by opening up the brain and shocking different parts
and those part correspond to parts of body
arm
shown
in the diagram there
that to things to notice
about these maps
tom
for sisters comparable
popular radical
and what this means is
hitherto parts of the
your honor body
but we close together on the brain
so you're on
your tongue is closer to your jaw
then it is to your
get
and a body
so to
in both the motor cortex
in a somatosensory cortex
also you'll notice that this
minds of the body par
representative brain
does not correspond to the sides of body art
in a real world
rather what determines the size in the brain
is
they of is the extent to which either they have more work man
or sensory
control
so the whole lot sensory organs princes
focus on your tong
and that's why that's okay
an enormous amount of face
by your on your the shoulder
is the been getting naked on the
the low your shoulder maybe begun you tom
does not much going on
in fact
if you draw diagram of a person
what they're body is corresponding can about this madness
you get something
that
that's your sensory
body
the fung
now
so you have these maps in your head
the thing to realize is
these maps a party or ports
this realizes
that's important are
of what goes on your brain
but
less than one quarter of the cortex
contains use max for projection areas
the rest
is involved in language and reasoning in moral thought
and some
and in fact a proportion as you go from rap have monkey humans
less than less of the
is devoted to projection areas and warn more
to affect
so
how do we figure out
what the other parts
of the brain do
well there's all sorts of methods
typically these are
reasoning imaging methods
like caste man
head stand
and s them on
oh
which
as i said before show parts your brain work
if you wanna know which party your brain is responsible for
language
you could put somebody to a scanner
and have them
explosive language are doing with the casper op or something
in and see what parts are brain
our active
on
another way
to explore
what the brain does
to consider what happens to people
when very bad things happen to their brain
tom in these bad things could happen through lesions
tumors
through strokes
ah from injury
on for most partner of psychologist don't like helmet laws
on
you're a psychologist logan motorcycle is right that helmets
because you therefore will accidents
we gain great insights into how the brain works
arm and a logic is
find somebody cruelly divides of the
it's damage to this part of the brain right here
and that person
can't recognize faces
there's some reasonable way that this part of the brain
is related to face
ignition
ah
and so through side a
of brain back
and a study that we we can
gains understanding
of what different parts of the brain do
the people study brain damage is
ah brain damage the cable kate's
motor control
such as apraxia
and what's interesting about apraxia is
it's not a route
some new of a racks yet
to move
do simple movements just fine
but they can't coordinator
they can't do something like waved goodbye
or like a cigarette
there's agnosia
and agnosia is a disorder which isn't blind
as a person could still see perfectly well
i as are intact
the rather what happens in agnosia is
they they they whose ability to recognize
sometimes is describes as psychic blindness
how
and so they may get visual agnosia whose devoted to recognize
they may get prosopagnosia
and lose the vividly
to recognize
faces
there are of the door disorders of sensory neglect
ah some famous disorders
again it's not paralysis is not minds
the do certain parts of your of bad parts your brain
you might lose for instance
the idea
that is a left side of body
or left side of the world
these days or so interesting
a one a devote some time to class the next
he weeks
to discussing them
there are disorders of language
like aphasia
on the classic case was discovered by paul broke that
in eighteen sixty one
haitian you i data part of his brain
and can only say one work
tac
and of are they can can can
can
and everything else was gong
calm
there's other disorders of language
we're person could speak
very fluid way
but the words don't make any sense
and he can't understanding body else
ah other disorders that will discuss later on
lou acquired psychopathy
where damage to parts you brain vertically
related to the frontal loads
on robbed you of ability to tell right from wrong
the final i wanted and
we're talking about neurons connects me neurons how neurons or why that
parts of the brain what the different parts
i wanna and like talking with the two hands of the brain
and asked the question how many minds
do you have
now if you look at the brain
if you took the brain l held up
it would look pretty cement ripple
but actually is not
their actual differences
between the right hemisphere and a left comes
how many people here
are right and
and people here are left and
honey people here are for complicated
and he gets just don't know
bit of the right to left
those of you who are right handed
bomb
which can prizes of a miners and people
have language in your left hemisphere
and in fact when we talking of a right handed people
for most burning denies agent
and what all talk about now
those of you or left handed
are more complicated
on some of you out language under right hemisphere
some in your left hemisphere
some god knows where
bomb
now the idea is
that's something to duplicate
so if you will lose half your brain the other happen actually do a lot
but something's are more prevalent and more powerful
in one part of the brain
and other
no one a show your brief film clip from scientific american illustrates
the differences brain hemispheres
but before doing that one of right into about re
fast
on
some functions are lateralized typically language in the left again
this is a right and eccentric
thank
but your right hand of language and what
math music on right
dualism crossover
and is important when we think about the studies that will follow
crossover is
everything you see in a left visual field both to right side
everything and right visual field
most left side brain
and similar wait there's a crossover in action
c. right hemisphere controls left side of body
you're left hemisphere
controls right side
now
finally
the two hats are connected
you're connected by this huge
where
call corpus glove
animals venice get best
because
the movie illustration
will go through some of us
this illustrate certain things that are discussed in detail
in a break
concerning lateralization
of different parts
of
the mental capacity is
some left hemisphere summon a right hemisphere
but also serves as useful math logical
arm
develop
which is is a nice illustration
as to how looking at people
who aren't
holy unusual
such as this man had this brain
by sector
does left hemisphere nerves right chemist
communication
how looking at such people subjects
djin cases
number bodies of some understanding
of how we normally do side
and this again is a theme
or return to
throughout the course
i'm
this is
generally the gentleman introduction of the brain that i want
five
giving a framework for what optic talking about
later on throughout the course of that
i might later on a reference to neurons
are neurotransmitters pork
hemisphere
you'll certain happen background understand what i'm talking about
but
i wanna in this first real class
with up
a bit humility
as a what psychologist know and don't
so the idea behind a lot of psychology
we'll odd nervous time
to mind is information
as in lambert computer
bomb
and so we study
different problems like recognizing faces or a language are motor
or logic
that he then often is to figure
how what sort of program
can solve these problems
and then we don't want fast
how could this program against and shoot it
in a physical lying
so we would is always steady people much as we just
area computer
while person
and i think the that
this strategies one i'm very enthusiastic about
but are still remains
what's sometimes called the hard problem
consciousness
and this involved subjective experience
what's it like
so my computer
can
play chess
my computer can
recognize numbers
you math
and maybe it does a
climate same with mind you
oh my computer
doesn't have field
in the things s
ah
this is these are two classic illustrations on
is it from a very old start at
in illustrates acts
i think a starship vogel of something
on
and that my over kidnapped
ah
and so the question is
has a thing like that
give rise to consciousness
areas
in this is that the postal and
all of some psychologists and philosophers think they've saul
most of us are lobster
most of us think we have
so far to go before we answer question for cops
i'm huxley points a
how it is that anything so remarkable as a
state of consciousness comes about
as a result irritating nervous
just as unaccountable
appearance of the djin
jeannie
when a lack rubbed his lap
seems like magic
that of flashy lump of gray discussed in the
can give rise to the city's feelings
the seconded about a while and the class on
is
i am presenting human presenting throw this a master
wait and call mechanistic conception of mental life
i'm not only talking about beautiful it is now wonderfully business
jerry's it is
rather when we find books
when
when we tried to explain fundamental aspects
of ourselves
floating questions like firing a decision
why we love our children
what happens when the fall
and song
now
you might find
this sort of project
in and
to be ripped out
you my
we're a
about how this well this matches
humanist values
for instance
when we do you know one another no legal about morals
we think it terms of free will and responsibility
if you put right you caught me off
you chose to do that
you know it reflects badly on you
if you save a life that risky are wrong
you're view you deserve
right you did something wonderful
it might be hard to match this
look conception which all actions are result
of neuro chemical physical processor
it might also be argument notion suggest
cord intrinsic value people
and finally my descartes
to match to mechanistic notion of the mind
with
the idea people that's
faced with this tension
there are three possible it's
you might choose to reject assigned to the conception of them
many people do
you may choose to
brace dualism
reject the idea that the brain
is responsible for mental life
and reject thomas of the scientists
alternative way
you might choose to embrace assigned the world view
and reject always humanist values
an are some philosophers and psychologist
who do just that
plain that free will
and responsibility and spiritual value intrinsic value
our old missions
the scientific notion
that could washed away
in modern science
or you try to reconciled
you try of the euro tout
to mesh you signed the view of mine
with
these human s values
you might wanna is are
this is an issue which and returned view
to of course
cos young mind set
