I'D LIKE TO WELCOME PEOPLE TO THIS COURSE INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY MY NAME IS DR PAUL BLOOM I'M PROFESSOR OF THIS COURSE AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE IS A COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THE HUMAN MIND SO WE ARE GOING TO COVER A VERY VERY WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS INCLUDING BRAINS CHILDREN LANGUAGE SEX MEMORY MADNESS DISGUST RACISM AND LOVE AND MANY OTHERS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE PROPER EXPLANATION FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ANIMALS CAN LEARN LANGUAGE THE PUZZLE OF WHAT GROSSES US OUT THE PROBLEM OF WHY SOME OF US EAT TOO MUCH AND WHAT WE COULD DO TO STOP THE QUESTION OF WHY PEOPLE GO CRAZY IN GROUPS RESEARCH INTO WHETHER YOU COULD TRUST YOUR CHILDHOOD MEMORIES RESEARCH INTO WHY SOME OF US GET DEPRESSED AND OTHERS DON'T THE STYLE OF THIS IS THERE'LL BE TWO LECTURES A WEEK AS WELL AS COURSE READINGS NOW TO DO WELL IN THE COURSE YOU HAVE TO ATTEND BOTH THE LECTURES AND DO THE READINGS THERE WILL BE SOME OVERLAP IN SOME CASES THE LECTURES WILL BE QUITE LINKED TO THE READINGS BUT THERE WILL BE SOME PARTS OF THE READINGS THAT WILL NOT FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE LECTURES AND SOME LECTURES SOME ENTIRE LECTURES THAT WILL NOT CONNECT AT ALL TO THE READINGS SO TO PURSUE THIS COURSE PROPERLY YOU HAVE TO DO BOTH WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU MISS A CLASS YOU NEED TO GET NOTES AND SO YOU SHOULD GET THEM FROM A FRIEND OR FROM THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU THE SLIDES ARE GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN YOU TAKE NOTES ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE BUT IF YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING ON THERE IT'LL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE I'M GOING TO POST IT IN A FORMAT WHICH WILL BE BLACK AND WHITE AND EASY TO PRINT OUT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS BUT AGAIN ATTENDING TO THE SLIDES IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ATTENDING CLASS THERE'S A TEXTBOOK PETER GRAY'S PSYCHOLOGY 5TH EDITION AND THERE'S ALSO A COLLECTION OF SHORT READINGS THE NORTON READER EDITED BY GARY MARCUS IT'S AN EXCELLENT TEXTBOOK IT'S AN EXCELLENT COLLECTION AND YOU SHOULD GET THEM BOTH THEY'RE AVAILABLE AT LABYRINTH BOOKSTORE ON YORK STREET OR YOU GET THEM ONLINE I SHOULD NOTE THAT LAST TIME I TAUGHT THE COURSE I USED THE MARCUS READER AND WHEN PROFESSOR MARVIN CHUN TAUGHT HIS COURSE LAST SEMESTER HE USED PETER GRAY'S 5TH EDITION TEXTBOOK SO THERE MAY BE A LOT OF USED COPIES FLOATING AROUND YOU SHOULD FEEL FREE TO TRY TO GET ONE OF THOSE THE EVALUATION GOES LIKE THIS THERE IS A MIDTERM AND THERE IS A FINAL THE FINAL WILL NOT BE HELD IN THE EXAM PERIOD BECAUSE I LIKE TO TAKE LONG VACATIONS IT WILL BE HELD THE LAST DAY OF CLASS THE EXAMS WILL BE MULTIPLE CHOICE AND SHORT ANSWER FILL IN THE BLANK THAT SORT OF THING PRIOR TO THE EXAMS I WILL POST PREVIOUS EXAMS ONLINE SO YOU HAVE A FEELING FOR HOW THESE EXAMS WORK AND SO ON THERE WILL ALSO BE REVIEW SESSIONS STARTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD WEEK OF CLASS Â€ THAT IS NOT NEXT WEEK BUT THE WEEK AFTER Â€ ON EACH MONDAY I'M GOING TO PUT UP A BRIEF QUESTION OR SET OF QUESTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE TO ANSWER AND YOUR ANSWERS NEED TO BE SENT TO YOUR TEACHING FELLOW AND YOU'LL BE GIVEN A TEACHING FELLOW ASSIGNED ONE BY FRIDAY THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE DIFFICULT IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE MORE THAN FIVE TEN MINUTES OF WORK BUT THE POINT OF THE QUESTION 15 20 MINUTES OF WORK BUT THE POINT OF THE QUESTION IS TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE MATERIAL AND DO THE READINGS THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE MARKED PASS FAIL I EXPECT MOST EVERYBODY COULD PASS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BUT IT'S JUST TO KEEP YOU ON TRACK AND KEEP YOU GOING THERE IS A BOOK REVIEW A SHORT BOOK REVIEW TO BE WRITTEN TOWARDS NEAR THE END OF THE CLASS I'LL GIVE DETAILS ABOUT THAT LATER ON IN THE SEMESTER AND THERE'S ALSO AN EXPERIMENTAL PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENT AND NEXT WEEK I'LL HAND OUT A PIECE OF PAPER DESCRIBING THE REQUIREMENT THE POINT OF THE REQUIREMENT IS TO GIVE YOU ALL EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY SEEING WHAT PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH IS ABOUT AS WELL AS TO GIVE US HUNDREDS OF SUBJECTS TO DO OUR EXPERIMENTS ON THE ISSUE SOMETIMES COMES UP AS TO HOW TO DO WELL IN THE COURSE HERE'S HOW TO DO WELL ATTEND ALL THE CLASSES KEEP UP WITH THE READINGS IDEALLY KEEP UP WITH THE READINGS BEFORE YOU COME TO CLASS AND ONE THING I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST IS TO FORM SOME SORT OF STUDY GROUPS EITHER FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY HAVE PEOPLE YOU COULD TALK TO WHEN THE PRIOR TO THE EXAMS OR SHE'S PATTING SOMEBODY NEXT TO HER I HOPE YOU KNOW HIM AND IN FACT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOT THIS CLASS BECAUSE IT'S SHOPPING PERIOD I DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING NEXT CLASS OR WHAT BUT I'LL SET UP A FEW MINUTES PRIOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLASS FOR PEOPLE JUST TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO THE PERSON NEXT TO THEM SO THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF RESOURCE IN THE CLASS NOW THIS IS A LARGE CLASS AND IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT CAN BE VERY ANONYMOUS AND SOME OF YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE IT THAT WAY AND THAT'S TOTALLY FINE BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO IS ESTABLISH SOME CONTACT WITH US EITHER WITH ME OR WITH ANY OF THE TEACHING FELLOWS AND I'LL INTRODUCE THE TEACHING FELLOWS SOMETIME NEXT WEEK YOU COULD TALK TO US AT THE BEGINNING OR AT THE END OF CLASS UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES I ALWAYS TRY TO COME AT LEAST TEN MINUTES EARLY AND I AM WILLING TO STAY LATE TO TALK TO PEOPLE YOU COULD COME BY DURING MY OFFICE HOURS WHICH ARE ON THE SYLLABUS AND YOU COULD SEND ME E-MAIL AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT I'M VERY WILLING TO TALK TO STUDENTS ABOUT INTELLECTUAL IDEAS ABOUT COURSE PROBLEMS AND SO ON AND IF YOU SEE ME AT SOME POINT JUST ON CAMPUS YOU COULD INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND I'D LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE FROM THIS CLASS SO AGAIN I WANT TO STRESS YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF STAYING ANONYMOUS IN THIS CLASS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF SEEKING OUT AND MAKING SOME SORT OF CONTACT WITH US OKAY THAT'S THE FORMAL STUFF OF THE COURSE WHAT'S THIS COURSE ABOUT UNLIKE A LOT OF OTHER COURSES SOME PEOPLE COME TO INTRO PSYCHOLOGY WITH SOME UNUSUAL MOTIVATIONS MAYBE YOU'RE CRAZY AND HOPE TO BECOME LESS CRAZY LAUGHER MAYBE YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO STUDY BETTER IMPROVE YOUR SEX LIFE INTERPRET YOUR DREAMS AND WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE LAUGHER THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD REASONS TO TAKE THIS COURSE AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SEX PART THIS COURSE MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP YOU OUT WITH SOME OF THESE THINGS THE STUDY OF SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY HAS A LOT OF INSIGHTS OF REAL WORLD RELEVANCE TO REAL PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AND I'M GOING TO TRY AND WHEN THESE ISSUES COME UP I'M GOING TO TRY TO STRESS THEM AND MAKE YOU TRY TO THINK ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE LABORATORY RESEARCH I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT CAN AFFECT YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE HOW YOU STUDY HOW YOU INTERACT WITH PEOPLE HOW YOU MIGHT TRY TO PERSUADE SOMEBODY OF SOMETHING ELSE WHAT SORT OF THERAPY WORKS BEST FOR YOU BUT THE GENERAL GOALS OF THIS COURSE ARE ACTUALLY I THINK EVEN MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS PROVIDE A STATE OF THE ART INTRODUCTION TO THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT THERE IS US HOW THE HUMAN MIND WORKS HOW WE THINK WHAT MAKES US WHAT WE ARE AND WE'LL BE APPROACHING THIS FROM A RANGE OF DIRECTIONS SO TRADITIONALLY PSYCHOLOGY IS OFTEN BROKEN UP INTO THE FOLLOWING INTO FIVE SUB-AREAS NEUROSCIENCE WHICH IS THE STUDY OF THE MIND BY LOOKING AT THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENTAL WHICH IS THE AREA WHICH I FOCUS MOSTLY ON WHICH IS TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW PEOPLE DEVELOP AND GROW AND LEARN COGNITIVE WHICH IS THE ONE TERM OF THE FIVE THAT MIGHT BE UNFAMILIAR TO SOME OF YOU BUT IT REFERS TO A SORT OF COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH TO STUDYING THE MIND OFTEN VIEWING THE MIND ON ANALOGY WITH A COMPUTER AND LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE DO THINGS LIKE UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE RECOGNIZE OBJECTS PLAY GAMES AND SO ON THERE IS SOCIAL WHICH IS THE STUDY OF HOW PEOPLE ACT IN GROUPS HOW PEOPLE ACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THERE IS CLINICAL WHICH IS MAYBE THE ASPECT OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT PEOPLE THINK OF IMMEDIATELY WHEN THEY HEAR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS THE STUDY OF MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND WE'LL BE COVERING ALL OF THOSE AREAS WE'LL ALSO BE COVERING A SET OF RELATED AREAS I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU CANNOT STUDY THE MIND SOLELY BY LOOKING AT THE DISCIPLINE OF PSYCHOLOGY THE DISCIPLINE OF PSYCHOLOGY SPILLS OVER TO ISSUES OF HOW THE MIND HAS EVOLVED ECONOMICS AND GAME THEORY ARE NOW ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR UNDERSTANDING HUMAN THOUGHT AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR THOSE ISSUES CONNECTING TO PHILOSOPHY COMPUTER SCIENCE ANTHROPOLOGY LITERATURE THEOLOGY AND MANY MANY OTHER DOMAINS SO THIS COURSE WILL BE WIDE RANGING IN THAT SENSE AT THIS POINT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING IN GENERALITIES SO I WANT TO CLOSE THIS INTRODUCTORY CLASS BY GIVING FIVE EXAMPLES OF THE SORTS OF TOPICS WE'LL BE COVERING AND I'LL START WITH THE TOPIC THAT WE'LL BE COVERING NEXT WEEK ON MONDAY Â€ THE BRAIN THIS IS A BRAIN IN FACT IT'S A SPECIFIC PERSON'S BRAIN AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE BRAIN IS THAT LITTLE WHITE MARK THERE IT'S HER BRAIN IT'S TERRI SCHIAVO'S BRAIN YOU RECOGNIZE HER MORE FROM PICTURES LIKE THAT AND WHAT A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE SOMEBODY IS IN A COMA IS WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS AS A RESULT OF DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN IS A STARK ILLUSTRATION OF THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF MENTAL LIFE THE PHYSICAL BASIS FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE NORMALLY HOLD DEAR LIKE FREE WILL CONSCIOUSNESS MORALITY AND EMOTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BEGIN THE COURSE WITH TALKING ABOUT HOW A PHYSICAL THING CAN GIVE RISE TO MENTAL LIFE WE'LL TALK A LOT ABOUT CHILDREN THIS IS ACTUALLY A SPECIFIC CHILD IT'S MY SON ZACHARY MY YOUNGER SON DRESSED UP AS SPIDER-MAN BUT IT IS HALLOWEEN NO IT'S NOT HALLOWEEN OH WELL THERE'S MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT LAUGHTER I STUDY CHILD DEVELOPMENT FOR A LIVING AND I'M INTERESTED IN SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO ONE QUESTION IS JUST THE QUESTION OF DEVELOPMENT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM CAN SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND ENGLISH EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS HOW PHYSICAL THINGS BEHAVE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS SOME UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER PEOPLE AND HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE AND THE QUESTION THAT PREOCCUPIES DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGISTS IS HOW DO WE COME TO HAVE THIS KNOWLEDGE AND IN PARTICULAR HOW MUCH OF IT IS HARD-WIRED BUILT-IN INNATE AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS THE PRODUCT OF CULTURE OF LANGUAGE OF SCHOOLING AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGISTS USE MANY INGENIOUS METHODS TO TRY TO PULL THESE APART AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF HUMAN NATURE THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF CONTINUITY TO WHAT EXTENT IS ZACHARY AT THAT AGE GOING TO BE THAT WAY FOREVER TO WHAT EXTENT IS YOUR FATE SEALED TO WHAT EXTENT COULD IF I WERE TO MEET YOU WHEN YOU WERE FIVE YEARS OLD I COULD DESCRIBE THE WAY YOU ARE NOW THE POET WILLIAM WORDSWORTH WROTE THE CHILD IS FATHER TO THE MAN AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN SEE WITHIN EVERY CHILD THE ADULT HE OR SHE WILL BECOME WE WILL LOOK AND ASK THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS TRUE IS IT TRUE FOR YOUR PERSONALITY IS IT TRUE FOR YOUR INTERESTS IS IT TRUE FOR YOUR INTELLIGENCE ANOTHER QUESTION HAVING TO DO WITH DEVELOPMENT IS WHAT MAKES US THE WAY WE ARE WE'RE DIFFERENT IN A LOT OF WAYS THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM DIFFER ACCORDING TO THEIR TASTE IN FOOD THEY DIFFER ACCORDING TO THEIR IQS WHETHER THEY'RE AGGRESSIVE OR SHY WHETHER THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO MALES FEMALES BOTH OR NEITHER WHETHER THEY ARE GOOD AT MUSIC WHETHER THEY ARE POLITICALLY LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE WHY ARE WE DIFFERENT WHAT'S THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT AND AGAIN THIS COULD BE TRANSLATED IN TERMS OF A QUESTION OF GENES AND ENVIRONMENT TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THINGS THE RESULT OF THE GENES WE POSSESS TO WHAT EXTENT ARE OUR INDIVIDUAL NATURES THE RESULT OF HOW WE WERE RAISED AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THEY BEST EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF AN INTERACTION ONE COMMON THEORY FOR INSTANCE IS THAT WE ARE SHAPED BY OUR PARENTS THIS WAS BEST SUMMARIZED MOST FAMOUSLY BY THE BRITISH POET PHILIP LARKIN WHO WROTE THEY MESS YOU UP YOUR MUM AND DAD THEY MAY NOT MEAN TO BUT THEY DO THEY FILL YOU WITH THE FAULTS THEY HAD AND ADD SOME EXTRA JUST FOR YOU IS HE RIGHT IT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL YOU-- IT'S BEEN A SERIES OF A HUGE CONTROVERSY IN THE POPULAR CULTURE TO THE EXTENT OF WHICH PARENTS MATTER AND THIS IS AN ISSUE WHICH WILL PREOCCUPY US FOR MUCH OF THE COURSE A DIFFERENT QUESTION WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY ATTRACTIVE AND THIS CAN BE ASKED AT ALL SORTS OF LEVELS BUT A SIMPLE LEVEL IS WHAT MAKES FOR A PRETTY FACE SO THESE ARE ACCORDING TO RATINGS VERY ATTRACTIVE FACES THEY ARE NOT THE FACES OF REAL PEOPLE WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN ARE COMPUTER GENERATED FACES OF A CAUCASIAN MALE AND A CAUCASIAN FEMALE WHO DON'T EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD BUT THROUGH USING THIS SORT OF COMPUTER GENERATION AND THEN ASKING PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK OF THIS FACE WHAT THEY THINK OF THAT FACE SCIENTISTS HAVE COME TO SOME SENSE AS TO WHAT REALLY MAKES A FACE ATTRACTIVE BOTH WITHIN CULTURES AND ACROSS CULTURES AND THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH WE'RE GOING TO DEVOTE SOME TIME TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SEX NOT ALL ATTRACTIVENESS NOT ALL BEAUTY OF COURSE IS LINKED TO SEX SO PANDAS FOR INSTANCE LIKE THIS PANDA ARE NOTORIOUSLY CUTE AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT REALLY IT'S JUST A CUTE PICTURE LAUGHTER MORALITY IS EXTREMELY CENTRAL TO OUR LIVES AND A DEEP QUESTION WHICH WE WILL STRUGGLE WITH THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE COURSE IS THE QUESTION OF GOOD AND EVIL EVIL AND GOOD THESE THREE PICTURES EXEMPLIFY DIFFERENT SORTS OF EVIL WHAT YOU COULD CALL INSTITUTIONAL EVIL BY SOMEBODY BEHAVING CRUELLY TOWARD SOMEBODY ELSE PERHAPS NOT DUE TO MALICE BUT BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT SHE'S IN IT HAS PICTURE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN A MASS MURDERER OR DRIVEN BY POLITICAL CAUSE AND THEN THERE'S THIS GUY ON THE BOTTOM ANYBODY KNOW WHO HE IS TED BUNDY WHO GOT THAT FILM THAT MAN LAUGHTER NO TED BUNDY EXACTLY AND THAT'S BEFORE WE GET INTO THE TECHNICAL STUFF LIKE CRAZY-EVIL AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT AND AGAIN THE SAME SITUATION COMES UP IS IT PART OF YOUR NATURE TO BE GOOD OR BAD OR IS IT LARGELY DUE TO THE SITUATION THAT YOU FALL IN AND THERE'S A LOT OF SOME QUITE SPECTACULAR EXPERIMENTS THAT TRY TO TEASE THAT APART IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EVIL WE SHOULD ALSO TALK ABOUT GOOD THESE ARE PICTURES OF TWO NOTORIOUSLY GOOD MEN OSKAR SCHINDLER AND PAUL RUSESABAGINA EACH WHO AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN HISTORY SAVED THE LIVES OF MANY MANY PEOPLE AT GREAT RISK TO THEMSELVES SCHINDLER IN THE HOLOCAUST AND THEN THE OTHER GUY IN Â€ AND I CAN'T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME Â€ RUSESABAGINA IN RWANDA AND THEY BOTH HAD REAL GOOD MOVIES MADE ABOUT THEM BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH THESE CASES IS YOU COULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED AHEAD OF TIME THAT THEY WOULD BE HEROES AND ONE PERSONAL ISSUE WITHIN ANY OF US IS WHAT WOULD WE DO IN SUCH SITUATIONS FINALLY THROUGHOUT THIS COURSE WE WILL DISCUSS MENTAL ILLNESS NOW TOWARDS THE END OF THE CLASS I WANT TO DEVOTE A FULL WEEK TO DISCUSSING MAJOR DISORDERS LIKE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY BECAUSE OF THEIR PROFOUND SOCIAL IMPORTANCE SUCH DISORDERS ARE REASONABLY COMMON IN COLLEGE STUDENTS MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM A MOOD DISORDER AN ANXIETY DISORDER OR BOTH AND I WON'T ASK FOR A SHOW OF HANDS BUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE ON SOME FORM OF MEDICATION FOR THIS DISORDER AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE CURRENT RESEARCH AND WHY PEOPLE GET THESE DISORDERS AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE THEM BETTER BUT I ALSO HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR THE LESS COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS THAT I THINK TELL US SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT MENTAL LIFE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MEMORY FOR INSTANCE WE'LL TALK ABOUT DISORDERS IN MEMORY INCLUDING SOME DISORDERS THAT KEEP YOU FROM FORMING NEW MEMORIES AS WELL AS DISORDERS OF AMNESIA WHERE YOU FORGET THE PAST AND THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY INTERESTING FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS EARLY IN THE COURSE IN FACT I THINK NEXT WEEK WE WILL DISCUSS NO LATER ON IN THE COURSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEMESTER WE WILL DISCUSS AN AMAZING CASE OF PHINEAS GAGE PHINEAS GAGE WAS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO DUE TO AN EXPLOSION A METAL PIPE WENT THROUGH HIS HEAD LIKE SO MIRACULOUSLY HE WAS NOT KILLED IN FACT HIS FRIENDS IT WENT THROUGH HIS HEAD WENT ENDED UP 100 FEET AWAY COVERED WITH BRAINS AND BLOOD AND PHINEAS GAGE SAT DOWN AND WENT UH OH AND THEN ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL THEY STOPPED BY A PUB TO HAVE SOME CIDER HE WAS NOT BLIND HE WAS NOT DEAF HE WAS NOT RETARDED BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED TO HIM HE LOST HIS SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG HE LOST HIS CONTROL HE USED TO BE A HARD-WORKING FAMILY MAN AFTER THE ACCIDENT HE LOST ALL OF THAT HE COULDN'T HOLD A JOB HE COULDN'T STAY FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE HE COULDN'T SPEAK FOR FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT CURSING HE GOT INTO FIGHTS HE GOT INTO BRAWLS HE GOT DRUNK HE LOST HIS CONTROL HE ENDED UP ON A CIRCUS SIDESHOW TRAVELING THROUGH THE COUNTRY WITH THE BIG STEEL PIPE THAT WENT THROUGH HIS HEAD AND THIS IS AGAIN AN EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE OF HOW THE BRAIN CAN GIVE RISE TO THE MIND AND HOW THINGS THAT GO WRONG WITH THE BRAIN CAN AFFECT YOU IN A SERIOUS WAY WE'LL DISCUSS CASES OF MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSONALITY AND ALSO DISCUSS THE DEBATE OVER WHETHER SUCH CASES ARE TRUE OR NOT WHETHER THEY COULD BE TAKEN AS A REAL PHENOMENA OR A MADE-UP PHENOMENA WHICH IS THERE IS A MATTER OF A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND THEN WE'LL EVEN DISCUSS SOME RARER CASES LIKE CAPGRAS SYNDROME CAPGRAS SYNDROME IS TYPICALLY Â€ THERE'S HUNDREDS OF CASES NOT MANY Â€ HUNDREDS OF CASES IT'S TYPICALLY THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF STROKE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU IS VERY SPECIFIC YOU DEVELOP A PARTICULAR DELUSION LIKE IT'S GETTING DARK LIGHTS DIM IN THE ROOM LAUGHTER FOLLOWS AND THE DELUSION IS THAT THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE THE MOST HAVE BEEN REPLACED THEY'VE BEEN REPLACED BY ALIENS OR ROBOTS LIGHTS GO ON Â€ THANK YOU Â€ BY MARTIANS BY CIA AGENTS BY TRAINED ACTORS AND ACTRESSES BUT THE PEOPLE BUT THE IDEA IS THE PEOPLE YOU CARE FOR THE MOST YOU BELIEVE ARE GONE AND THIS COULD LEAD TO TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES CAPGRAS SYNDROME IS ASSOCIATED WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF VIOLENCE ONE MAN IN AUSTRALIA A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WAS UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HIS FATHER WAS REPLACED WITH A ROBOT AND CUT OFF HIS HEAD A RELATED DISORDER INVOLVING THE VERY SAME PARTS OF THE BRAIN IS CALLED COTARD'S SYNDROME AND COTARD'S SYNDROME IS YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE DEAD YOU ARE PERSUADED THAT YOU'RE DEAD YOU'RE WALKING AROUND YOU KNOW YOU'RE WALKING AROUND AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND BUT YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE DEAD AND WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT THESE IS IT'S NOT THESE ARE NOT JUST SORT OF BIG SCREWY PROBLEMS OF MESSED UP PEOPLE RATHER THEY'RE LOCATED THEY'RE RELATED AT A PINPOINT LEVEL TO CERTAIN PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST MODERN THEORIES AS TO WHY THESE SYNDROMES OCCUR NOW THE REASON TO BE INTERESTED IN THEM AGAIN IS NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE FREQUENT THEY AREN'T AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF SOME SORT OF GRUESOME MORBID CURIOSITY RATHER BY LOOKING AT EXTREME CASES THEY CAN HELP US BEST UNDERSTAND NORMAL LIFE OFTEN BY LOOKING AT EXTREMES IT THROWS INTO SHARP CONTRAST THINGS WE NATURALLY TAKE FOR GRANTED THE ISSUE OF PSYCHOPATHY OF PEOPLE WHO EITHER DUE TO BRAIN DAMAGE OR BECAUSE THEY ARE BORN THAT WAY HAVE NO MORAL UNDERSTANDING CAN HELP US COPE WITH QUESTIONS OF FREE WILL AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP OR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MENTAL ILLNESS AND EVIL MULTIPLE PERSONALITY CASES FORCE US TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS A SELF TO WHAT EXTENT ARE ALL OF US COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE WE A SINGLE UNIFIED PERSON OVER TIME CASES LIKE CAPGRAS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY TELL US ABOUT HOW WE SEE THE WORLD THEY TELL US FOR INSTANCE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECOGNIZING SOMETHING IN THE SENSE THAT YOU COULD NAME IT AND KNOWING WHAT IT IS AND SO BY STUDYING THESE ABNORMAL CASES WE COULD GET SOME INSIGHT INTO REGULAR LIFE SO THAT'S THE END OF THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE EXAMPLE TOPICS THE SYLLABUS LISTS MANY MORE I'LL END BY TELLING YOU THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT I AM NOT EXPERT IN AND FORTUNATELY THERE IS A COMMUNITY AT YALE OF THE BEST SCHOLARS AND TEACHERS ON THE PLANET AND SO IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR ME NOT TO USE THEM TO COVER SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND SO I'M GOING TO INCLUDE FOUR GUEST LECTURERS THE FIRST ONE IS DR MARVIN CHUN WHO TEACHES THE INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY COURSE IN THE FALL AND IS MY COMPETITION AND HE'S GOING TO GIVE AN AMAZING LECTURE ON COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE ESPECIALLY THE COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE OF FACES DR SUSAN NOLEN-HOEKSEMA IS THE WORLD'S AUTHORITY ON DEPRESSION AND IN PARTICULAR ON SEX DIFFERENCES AND DEPRESSION AND SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOWARDS THE END OF THE COURSE KELLY BROWNELL IS GOING TO TALK IS HEAD OF THE RUDD CENTER FOCUSES ON OBESITY EATING DISORDERS DIETING AND HE'LL TALK ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FOOD AND FINALLY DR PETER SALOVEY DEAN OF YALE COLLEGE IS GOING TO COME TO US ON VALENTINE'S DAY AND TELL US EVERYTHING HE KNOWS ABOUT THE MYSTERIES OF LOVE ALL OF THESE DETAILS ARE IN THE SYLLABUS AND I'LL STICK AROUND AND ANSWER QUESTIONS HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
