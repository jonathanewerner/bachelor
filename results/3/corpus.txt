psychosexual stages
freuds five stages of personality
development each associated with a particular erogenous zone
fixation an attempt to achieve pleasure as an adult in ways that are equivalent to how it way
achieved in these stages
oral stage birth year
mouth is associated with sexual pleasure
weaning a child can lead to fixation if not handled correctly
fixation can lead to oral activities in adulthood
anal stage years
anus is associated with pleasure
toilet training can lead to fixation if not handled correctly
fixation can lead to anal retentive or expulsive behaviors in adulthood
phallic stage years
focus of pleasure shifts to the genitals
oedipus or electra complex can occur
fixation can lead to excessive masculinity in males and the need for attention or domination in females
oedipus complex

lets not think about sex for a while
latency stage puberty
sexuality is repressed
children participate in hobbies
school and same sex friendships
genital stage puberty on
sexual feelings re emerge and are oriented toward others
healthy adults find pleasure in love and work fixated adults have their energy tied up in earlier stages
defense mechanisms
unconscious mental processes
employed by the ego to reduce anxiety
defense mechanisms
sublimation displacement to activities that are valued by society
displacement re direction of shameful thoughts to more appropriate targets
defense mechanisms
projection reducing anxiety by attributing unacceptable impulses to someone else
rationalization reasoning away anxiety producing thoughts
regression retreating to a mode of behavior characteristic of an earlier stage of development
hysteria and its treatment
blindness and deafness paralysis
trembling panic attacks gaps of memory etc
these symptoms are a way of keeping emotionally charged memories under lock and key
when memories are recovered there
is catharsis an explosive release
hysteria and its treatment
freud originally tried to get at these memories through hypnosis but later
moved to free association patients offer resistance
freud used the methods of psychoanalysis to explore these conflicts

freud scientific assessment
falsifiability
karl popper
scientific predictions need to make strong claims about the world and run the risk of being proven false
freud you hate your mother
patient wow that makes sense
freud yes i am right
freud you hate your mother
patient no i dont what a terrible idea
freud your anger shows that this idea is painful to you you have repressed it
from consciousness i am right
freud adult personality traits are shaped by the course of psychosexual development
all dreams are disguised wish fulfillment
psychoanalysis is the best treatment for mental disorders
scientist i disagree there is little or no evidence that supports any of those claims
freud your rejection of my ideas shows that they are distressing to you this is because i am right
also you have deep psychological problems and require extensive therapy
when specific predictions are made they dont do too well
oral and anal characteristics
role of weaning and toilet training
sexual preference
success of psychoanalysis the core freudian insight the importance of the unconscious remains intact
