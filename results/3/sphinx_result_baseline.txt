last last we talked about the brain
now what pablo that
about some foundation
so today
and monday
when i talk of a two very big ideas
and these ideas are associated
with
sick man
freud
and b. f. skinner
and i cycle analysis and behaviors
and i want to talk about cycle analysis
today
and behaviors next week
now one of these things
one of the things that makes
theory so interesting
mr skull
mom
most of the work women talk about in this class most of the ideas are narrow
so it up with some wood is out somebody's idea
of a racial prejudiced
tom that's not a theory of language active
will talk about theories of schizophrenia
but they're not tom
explanations of sexual effectiveness
most theories are specialized there is
with these two views are a rat
the reached its theories of everything
in compass in just about everything that matter
david gay lifestyle of a woman mental illness religion war love
throwing skinner had explanations or look
and this is not a history course
i have zero interest
in describing historical figures in psychology
just for the sake telling you but because the field
what i wanna tell you about though
is i wanna talk about these ideas
you so much rest long
and even the importantly
ah
a lot of these ideas have critical influence
on how we think about
the present
and that's that
now
for better or worse
we live in a world profoundly affected by satan
freud
if i had to ask you
choose a psychotic not mean famous psychology
bastard
most to be freud
tom
he's the most famous psychologist ever
he's had a profound influence
on the twentieth and twenty first century
palm
some by grabbing from asian he was born in a fifties
spend most of his life and ah
the em up
austria
then down but he died in london
in the escape of london
soon after treating there at the beginning a war war two
as in axes began to occupy
where he lived
he's one of the most famous dollars ever
but he's not known for any single discover
instead is known for the development
oven and composing theory of mine
ah
one of the develop over the standard many decades
tom
he was
in this time mix
it really well
a celebrity recognize on the street
it's road is like he was a maddox
fort mary energy about activity
ah
in part because he was very serious cocaine addicts
but also just in general reduces a high energy sort of person
he was out for the nobel prize
in medicine and in literature
didn't get either one
didn't get the prize in medicine has albert einstein
everybody was albert einstein
while the mine's been really
road wrote a letter
day after opinions of other nobel prize
we're letter saying
don't get the price of freud
he doesn't deserve a nobel prize seizures psychologist
yeah
okay
ah
while his own waltz
universally a claim
as a profound in board intellectual figure
he's also the object of considerable dislike
ah this is in part because of his character
he was not a very nice man in many ways
he was deeply ambitious
to the cause of promoting cycle analysis
the because of presenting his view
and defending it
ah
then he was some
often dishonest
freely brutal too was friends
and i know terrible to his enemies
it was an interesting carrot my favorite freud
lori
was
as he was levy europe
you're in a rise of the nazis
as he was ready to go
to go demon
from mom i think either germany or austria
ah
he had to sign a letter from that the stock will to stop a wage
a intercepted
and demanded he signed a letter saying
that at no point in the been threatened
or harassed by the stop
so he signs the letter
in any rates underneath that
because stop o.'s not armenian anyway
that i highly recommend it to stop with everybody
it's a it's a it's
he had a certain aggression
to him
ah
it was also he's also disliked
often hated
because of his views
he was seen as a sexual renegade
for the conception of
of people
as good an ration pure beings
amen one and that's his rose to power in the nineteen thirties
he was identified as a shoe
who was devoted to just
drawing the most sacred notions
candidate
and in many aches
some extent
tom many people see in this way
and uh some extent
on this accusation has some truth to it
mom
freud made claims of boat people
that many of us
maybe most of us would rather not now
well okay
what are the sec
well
if you ask somebody
who doesn't like freud what he said gold
and in fact freud said a lot of things
some of which bomb
we're not very rational
for instance a bomb
he's well known for his account
ballot symbols arguing certain architectural monuments
our car
bout
sub consciously developed as
you know representations
bomb
and related to this he developed a notorious theory of penis envy
penis envy isn't isn't that an account of the development
okay
that everyone of you was
the layout has gone through according to freud
and ideas that you discovered
at some point about lament the lack of peanuts
tom
this is not this is a catastrophe
and so each of you
in for
at that point
the u. had been cast faded you at once
tom
happiness
but somebody had taken it from you
wow
you then
turn to your father
and blow your father
because your father has a penis
so uses are penis substitute
comp
you reject
your mother
julio unworthy to do her
penis slack
and
that shapes your psycho sexual development
about that sort of thing you know about freud you're not gonna have very high opinion
him
or of his work
but
at the core of freud sect nation
the more interesting ideas
is this
as a set of planes
of the man's intellectual important
and the two main ones are that's the two main ones involve existence
of an unconscious
unconscious motivation
and the notion of unconscious dynamics
sir unconscious
which leads man to illnesses
dreams
slopes of the tom and sell
the first idea the idea of unconscious motivation
tom
involves rejecting
the claim
but you know what you're doing
so suppose you fall in love right
a news item one american
and as somebody was asked to ask you walk
then you'd say something like well
i'm ready to get married a stage of my life i really love
martin attractive but one have kids
whatever
then maybe
this is true
but a freud in might say
the event this is your honest
you're not won
anybody else
still
tom
there are desires and motivation said govern your behavior
but you may not be aware
ah
so
in fact
you might wanna marry john
tom because he reminds you of your fall
or because you wanna get that somebody per be trained
on
somebody was just
tell you this
it's a that's a total nonsense
but that would teach her forty and affording would say that these processes are armed
so course you just don't know what's happening
so the radical idea year is
you might not know
why why you do
what you did
and this is something we accept the things that visual perception
we except you look around the world and you get sensations in you figure
here's a here's a card is a tree theirs
a new to some conscious about this happens
but
it's a unpleasant
and kind of frightening
this could happen
it this good
oh why did things like why you now studying at yale
why you feel the way you do
family
now
the marriage cases six
three
but freud gives a lot of simpler examples
with a sort of unconscious
motivation
might play a role
so have you ever like somebody or dislike them and not not know why
and he ever found yourself in a situation where you're
you're doing something
or you're arguing for something
or making a decision
for reasons that you can't
holy articulate
have you ever for god somebody's name
at exactly the wrong time
have you ever call up the wrong name in the throats of passion
this is all
the freud ian unconscious
the ideas that we do these things these things are it's
plain
cobb systems that were not aware of
now all of this would be fine
if you're unconscious was a reasonable rational computer if you unconscious was
really smart
and looking out for your best interest
but according to freud
that's not the way awards according to freud
there are three distinct roses is going on here at
and these aren't violent internal on
and the way you act in a way you think
products not of a c. you were
a rational being
but of a set of conflicting creatures
and is remarks
are they
the ego
and a super ego
and they emerge develop mentally
they did according to freud
present at birth
it's the abnormal heart of itself
it wants the eat drink
people
get warm and that sexual satisfaction
it is no bree just please
it works on what freud called a pleasure prints
it wants pleasure
annette wants it now
and that's according to fright
how human begins
purity it
freud had this wonderful phrase
polly mortars perverse it
your desire or what
now unfortunately like doesn't work like that
what you want
isn't always what you get
and this leads to a set of reactions
hope the fact
that leisure isn't always there when you want
either
by planning had a satisfy your desires
lower
planning
have a suppress them
in this system is known as the ego
or the cell
and it works
on
on the reality principle
ended it
it works on
principal trying to figure out a
how to make your way through the world
have a satisfy your letters or
some cases have to give up on
and the ego tub emerges of the ego
for freud
symbolizes
fortune of consciousness
finally
this was all there was
it might be a simpler world
but freud had a third component
that of the super heat
and a super ego
is the internal wise rules
parents
vi
so what happens in the course of development is
it is trying to make you wait for the world a satisfy years
fires
but sometimes you're punished
for that
some desires are inappropriate
some actions
are wrong
in your punished for it
the ideas that you come out you be
you get in your head
a super ebola conscience
these movies of the luckily angel about it that
tells you
when things are wrong
and basically yourself the ego
in between
they did
and the super ego
one thing to realize
i told you haiti is a rages fixed
it just as all
hungry phone sex
all let's get war all
the summer ego
is also stupid
the super ego corner porter's not some
really and moral philosopher
tell you are right now
is simply the sick
and you should be ashamed of yourself
knowing that all
and in between these two screening creatures one of you one of them
telling you see here desires other want helen to be ashamed of yourself
is you
is the eagle
now according to fright
most of this is unconscious
so we say a bubbling up the top we feel
very ants
ourselves
and a driving a bit did the forces of the good in the forces of this
iran contra
in that
we cannot access
we don't know what
psycho working as a lot of our
kidneys or or stands
you can eat respect and find them
rather they do their work
without conscious knowledge
now fright
develop this is is the fourteenth to reagan in in broad outline
he extended it
and develop it into a theory
of psycho sexual developed
and so freud theory is as i said before
there it everyday life
a decisions of the errors of falling a lot
it's also theory child bella
so freud believer five stages
personality involvement
and each is associated with
skinner a rotten us
stop
and ford will leave as well
that if you have a problem at a certain stage of something goes wrong
you'll be stuck there
so quarter freud or people in this room are what they are
because a cuts
in the world stage order anal stick
and then
that's not
so bill will stages when you start up
the note was associate of pleasure
everything is acting in chewing and so on
ah
and the problem for freud is
gray bridge sure we have a child
driving him out the bras
ah
could lead to serious problems
in his personality
it could make him
as a phrase go
goes into an oral person
and this or rowdy could be on
cried literally
it freud uses has next nation why somebody might eat too much
or chu got
or smoke
they're trying to achieve satisfaction
threw them out
of a sort a didn't get
in this very early stage of development
but also be more abs
um if your roommate is dependence and needy
you could then go to roommates a
your oral purse
the first year of your life did not go well
shh
a phrase even more popular
is the anal stage
and that happens after oral state
and problems can armored
bomb
if toilet training is not around
if you have problems during those years of likely to become
unable
personality
tom according to freud a year roommate it's a
your problem is
you're too again
and
going to freud literally
a man
your unwilling to part with your own
calm
two written down
ah
then and away manifests itself as you know just how people talk is
clean used in g.
this is the anal person out
then it gets older
more complicated
on the next phase of the ballot staged at this
would it
focus of pleasures
shifts to the generals
ah
and bomb
station
can lead to excessive masculine the
in females
warren fifty been nails
or
female need for attention or dominate
now at this point
something really interesting happen
call the evidence
complex
this is based on the story
the medical story of the key
who killed his father
and married his mother
and according to freud this happens to all of us
in in this way
while all of us by all of us
freud man
man
bomb
there's the idea
you're three or four years old
you're in the ballots
so what you interested well you're dressed you peanuts
ah
and then you say clinics
perot are object
freud sort of big about this but you know
you seek some sort of satisfaction
who's out there
who'll be sweet and kind and loving and wonderful
well
mom
set a trial of four pin first mom is nice
well now
so far so far citizen who does not
oh boy falling in love with mother
rob
dad said
pump
now
now this is gonna get progressive we will but i want this
father
to the two sons
both sides when two of phase with aids
was it lee said
they wanted to marry mommy and me
it's a name that happened to be that would get worse than war
so
so so recess
but now
get it gets a lowell that aggressive so set ideas that child determines
then he's going to kill his father
every three and we're with pigs
on but then because children a quarter freud don't map
sands
a
the boundary between are mine
in the world
which is is a problem the problem is
is they don't get a think their father
can tell
but you're plotting to kill
and they figure father's now angry at them
and then they asked themselves
the worst thing that could do to me
masters
cass ration
f. sewed a they come to the conclusion
father is going to cast breakdown
because eric illicit low
for their mom
and then they say
that's
and then it'll take about sex
for several years
and that the late sixties
the lazy stages
they've got news use them of mom and dad
fellow love of mom
one of the kill my father
that is gonna cass fate may
fellow love of mom
at a sex business
and it's sex is repressed
until you get the general stay
and a general stages
this stage we are all out
the healthy
adults
bomb
now that they're adults than you've gone through all the development
where would you stand united in the woods yet
because
on conscious magnus are still
even if you haven't got fix aided or anything
tom
there's still this dynamic
going on all the time
with you a ego in your shivering
calm and ideas
you super ego remember his super ego is
so you sober look isn't only telling you
not to that fact
telling you not to think that
so what's happening is a
you're you're did
is setting up oldest we're six
all of these crazy sexual and while desire
okay i'll kill
oh i'll have sex with that
owl
i'll have
to helping some i deserve
and
then
your superior
you should read izzy
no no no
in this that is repressed
doesn't even make it a consciousness
the problem is freud at a very
heidi lot lex
theory
of what goes on
and some other stuff slips out
and it shows up in dreams
shows up in slopes of calm
and in exceptional cases shows absurd
clinical
symptoms
so what happens is
for you describe a lot of normal life
as in terms of different ways we use
to keep that horrible stop running it
making its way the contest
in the call these
fence magnets
you defending yourself
again though
horrible parts
of yourself
as some of these make a little bit of sacks
i mean one way to describe this
in a non technical non protein ways
there's certain things about are suffering rather not
a certain desired rather not now
and we have waist high
so prisons are seldom age
so will nation is
you might have a lot of energy
maybe sexual energy or aggressive anarchy
but instead of turning into a sexual or aggressive
pardon
we do is you focus it in some other way
sync imagine a great artist like picasso
turning to sexual energy into is our
there is a bomb
there's displacement
this placement is calm
you have certain shameful plots are designers
and you re focus them more appropriate
a boy is bullied by his father
bomb
they've hey his father
and one i heard
this is is that this is very shameful and difficult
the boy mine's dead
the doc
it's think he takes it up
because that's a more acceptable target
bomb
there's projection
projection is
i have certain on concerned impulses i'm uncomfortable
so rather than own them myself
i project into somebody else
a classic example for freud
homosexual desires
tom
the ideas that i feel this tremendous loss
towards you
and
any any only
i'm
and
and
i'm ashamed of the slots
so wrestling senate
hey are you blessed looking at me the sexual manner
i knew lasting afternoon
have fun
because what i do it i take my own desired
and freud suggested
perhaps on all the way
that man who believe other men
who are obsessed with the sexuality of other men
our themselves
projecting away their own section
cyrus
there's ration wise asian
tom which is that when you do something writhing something back
you rational i say you give a war
socially exceptional explanation
ah a parent who enjoys
smack in his child
will typically not say i enjoy smack in my child rattle sec
for that child good
i'd be in good and by doing this
and finally there is progression which is returning to an earlier stage of development
can you actually see this in children
in times
of stress
prom wow
bill become younger
the whacked him
they might private sector thumb
get a blanket
so
now
these are all mechanisms that for freud are not the slay this bit pathological
they're part of normal life
normally we do these things
to keep an equal liberty
among the different systems of them caught
but sometimes it doesn't work
sometimes things go all right
and what happens is
phrase it's not currently used in psychology
it was popular during for it's time
tom
hysteria
hysteria includes phenomena like
hysterical blindness mr appalled that this which is when you cannot see
am i here
even though there's nothing physiological wrong with you
ah
paralysis trembling hand cutbacks
gaps of memory including him agents
and i da's
that these are actually symptoms
these are symptoms of mechanisms going on
keep things
unconscious
it's a common enough idea movies
often in movies what happens on a goes to analyze
that's a horrible problem
they can't remember something
what a s. insert a black yeltsin's own
and the analyst
pulls them some
and at one point
they get busy in sight
any realize what what why they wanted
why they can
and for flight this is what happens
freud originally
he get
these memories out
to hypnosis
but then moved to the mechanism of free association
and according to freud ideas
patients are resistance
ah
to this
and on and then the idea that psycho analyst
is
who
on
get over to resistance
and help patients
yet in sight
he notion of of of cycle analysis
your problems
are actually bomb
reflect the burr phenomena
you're hiding something from yourself
and once
you know what's going on deeper phenomena your problems
and let even example of a therapy session
now this is not a freud in analysis
will discuss later on the course what afford in analysis
he is
but this is not a cure for enough and forty announces words wind
does not seated therapist if there is is very non racked up
bought
i'm gonna present this as an example here
because illustrates
so many of them
routine beans
particularly themes boat frames
the importance of dreams
about repression and about hidden meaning
so this is from a television episode
and the characters many some of you may obscene as many do you want that
characters suffering
havoc
ah
in particular yes panic attacks
when he sees these
first patted attack originated
we want to a swimming pool
family of dots
fly away
impact
heart high heart pounding
sweating
flushed
any passed out
these panic attacks grew worse and worse
in philly sock there is
when the prescribe any medication
and this is
thus as one of his one of the meeting see hat
with the therapist
ford's contributions extend beyond
ah
that it individual psychology in individual pathology
mom
floyd have a lot to save a dreams
ties you to see in this illustration
the bullied the dreams hat bomb
a manifest continents
meaning
manifest meaning wayne hughes
barriers in years
the dreams always have awakened content as well maybe
the hidden
implication of thing
he viewed old ranges which fung
every mean you have to certain which you hat
even though might be a forbidden word
the wind which staff
one half
ah
and dreams had
common this is nike along the gate
freud
green's head symbolism
things in dreams
we're often not
the rather symbols for other things
tom
floyd believe the literature
to repay ills
stories to children and
and like
ah
carried
ah
certain
universal themes
certain aspects of unconscious
troubles
uncertain
pre occupations of our unconscious mind
troy that a lot save a religion
a
for instance
by the viewed
a large
part of our
of the idea of finding a singular all powerful blot
as c. your father figure
the some of us never hat
you're a development
what a wanna spend the rest of the class
on
is the scientific assessment of throats awaited was
far as i told you
freud had to say in broad outline
i don't wanna take on
time
to consider whether or not we should believe this
and how will it fits
for more
signs
before doing so on
i'll take questions for few minutes
above freud or freud studies
yes
so that some question the question isn't
conflicts
to live element
cried
is it is
always assumes that a trial as a mother and father
one of the jun a certain short of the millie ills
anne
the question then is
what if a child raised by single pair
for example
what are the trial was never rest that
bob mostar
and calm
and
freud is had had problems
freud
freud was very
focus
on family life of the people the interactive with
brother opera plaster
and then these are the questions would've been difficult
answer
i imagine that what a protein would have to say as you would expect systematic differences
so you would expect
child
we just grow up a mother this will be a father of a father
to be in some sense psychological
dammit
by that
they going to go through the normal
yes
ah the issue the question is
to modern cycle analysts
outs still believe that women
do not have super he goes
bomb
fry it was was as you point me out
korea's for pointy
annette women
ah
or morally image for
relative to men
i think freud would say that women had super he goes
it is not the sort of
thirty ones that man hat
how
i think psycho one was the site why would it
dollar trade now the next
some would maintain it really are deep sex differences
others would want to addison
that aspect for him
yes
also the nation is
a lot of these it's a good question question is the tubes were wet is celebration has a
other
fans magnets
a lot of defense mechanisms
calm
involved taking a desire
and turning it
now what displacement does is
take sip
from you
kirk
like i'm angry at you but maybe that's for been for some reasons
ah
what projection does this takes a desire for meat
and and puts it on somebody else petting it
and what celebration does is it just
gives out the details and keeps the energy
so you stay out you know you roommates face up on might work
and you say your roommate for instance on
that's just because
you haven't had sex in long
anyone have sex
to do a warrior energy
you're back to
and then
in a music fast
so a nation
and back into a sight
in your room in the very please
tom one more one more question
yes
the question is which is related to the issue
standing issue of the two pair first
about me
to what extent
are these notions valid it crossed cultural
and as such a good question nominate me for a mop top button of humans
that's actually
that's the city issue
up
the scientific assessment
of fraud
so much ready get your question
funnel that
ah
flights
floyd in theory
is
now at this point in time
extremely controversial
ah
and
there's a lot of well known criticism
and attacks on freud
is it is that you next one book
ah
on a man rewards by frederick
crews
which i'm an frederick cruisers winners
strongest
and most passionate critics of freud
and
they problem of freud
bomb
go like this
there are two ways you can rejected fear
the two problems with a scientific theory
mom
one way to reject the theory is that it could be wrong
so suppose i have a theory that
the reason why some children have boxes
a profound development was ordered
custer mothers don't love them
does a popular theory
for many years
it set
possible theory it just turns out to be wrong
but another way and and so one way to attack an address assigned to pick
theory
is on
is to view it as just to see whether or not a works
but there's a different problem theory that hat
i fear they could be sold a
and all and congress are
that on that it can't even be test
and this is one of the main critics
right
ah
the idea could be summed up by a rotation from the physicist
wolfgang all
and polly was asked his opinion
of another physicist
always said this
that guy's workers crap
he's not right
he's not even long
and a criticism of the riots
is that he's not a ow
bomb
the issue of dayton us
this summer i said no more technical way
but a philosopher
carl pop
who does drive
who introduced the term
liability
the idea of flaws
thing which is signed
from non sign
is it scientific productions
wrong claims about the world
and
these claims are of a sort
couldn't be proven wrong
they're not
science
so for example in psychology
sort of planes will be entertaining throat
ports
the clue planes like
damage to the hinted that the campus
causes failures of certain sorts of memory
or every learned world
man on average
one have more sexual partners and when
or exposure to violence television
n.'s image will run themselves more quiet
now
are they tour of a false will will talk about that
point here is
they can be vaults
they're interesting and ah
tom
that they can be tested
and as such
they go italy might be wrong
with a graduate level
of a sign critic
dear
ah
this should be contrasted with non sign that the programs
and the best example of a non sign that the program
is a strong legit
cromwell the straw poll after logical production
is not that they're wrong
is that they can't be around i'm not even
i did my vitamin horace go
today
on a wet
tom
a couple of negative ads that could make trouble for the keeper next few days
gonna watch that
presence of old mars and venus injection won a box of repeated
but keeping a piece of jake
or are million clothes will help you keep in touch
with your fun side
starting this morning i got my wife will piece of shit i have been sort of inspect my thoughts
the problem is
few days i gotta go bison
thought that was wrong
it can't be wrong
it's a soul bay
i got a better or spoke from the onion
palm
right at all part of smoke moment handicap a way to resolve
imagine all the character of this ups
that murder
now
that's
good for edition
because
well it's david turns out to be true
i was a nose dive really nonstop
also viable
ah
are you willie freud
tales of us
because freud been
theory
is often soul
they in flexible
that intend to really be tested in any reliable wait
a big problem of this is a lot of protein theories claim the ballot in course of cycle analysis
so when you ask people what you believe in fright
they want sale because of this experiment that experiment this davidson addicts it was a it
freud affording varied
most itself in a course of sight for now
the successive cycle
what is on wrought
i mean the problem is a freud says to page you a
pages
wow
access
for instance
andrea
vision for the u. a. imaginative
no i don't steal isis gaston
freud says
you and the show's is ideas painful for you pressed by either
hi hi
and
compliments
the same
sort of dine matter
plays itself out even in the sign her perk
the bait back and forth
ah
so freud freud in psychologist and putting floyd able what i mean is
well known then as a fork
we'll make some clients like it out
i'll personality traits are shaped by the course of psycho sexual bela month
all dreams of disguise wish for film
psycho analysis the best even for mental disorders
scientists will spawn i disagree visual on no evidence
or in this point
and affording responses
your rejection by the shows of yours fastened
this is because i am right
and this is often follow up
seriously enough
you deep psychological broth hi
and
now
no i don't wanna character
produce a lot of worries of
cried
and made a research program
of extending their ideas
scientifically
freeman to robots scientific fast
mom
but the problem is when you make specific fall viable production
they don't always do
that well
ah so presence is no evidence that oral and anal characteristics a personality characters
a book didi
verses beings dandy
related any interesting way
to wiener toilet for
and it's been some efforts cross culture boy
to rigid go back to question this young man
asked for
looking at a cross cultural differences and toilet training
we need which
sean
in any interesting way
personality differences
and as we know that
ah
similarly
bomb
troy that sons
wrong claims about sexuality
for why some people are straight another sergei
on the senate will very little air support
and the claimed a cycle analysis
proves itself
by being bites tremendous success in curing mental illness
is also
almost certainly not for
for most maybe not all but for most
so logical
there are quicker and more reliable treatment
and second houses
and is considerable controversy
as to whether
the toni soprano method of insight were you get this insight and this is
covering
oh now on hold
makes any real difference
in a levy a symptoms such as anxiety disorders
or are oppression
ah
this is why
we're sort of often sort of a sticker shock
when people go to university psychology department
what is a local
hey where's them
so i'm insect out that a classes on freud
who's your expert on freud
and it through this
freud ian cycle analysis
is almost never study
ah
not
the cognitive or development or side
not that one side
there are some exceptions
but for the most part
tom
even if he would do studied right
within psychology apartments do so credit
not
very few isn't would see themselves as a psycho
and what it cracked asian or
or as a roared into college
ah
floyd lives long
both in the clinical setting in in the university
freud
at yale forensics is much more likely to be found in the history department
n.'s a call
and this is typical
bought
despite all of this sort of sour things i did set a vote
right
the big idea
then ports
of the dynamic unconscious
remains intact
we will go over and over and over again
studies
we're some really interesting aspects of mental why
ah
prove
to be unconscious
now
there's one question that when escape or this
for reasons of time
bob
and just go
to some examples
of the unconscious
in modern technology
so
here's a simple example
of the unconscious
in modern technology
home
language
understanding
so when you hear a sentence
like
john thinks the bill likes him
in a fraction of a second
you realize
it does mean that john thinks the bill
likes john
if you're descendants
john things the bill like some cell
in a fraction of a second
you would think
that means john thanks to bill what's up
as we will get to when we get a lecture language
this is not conscious you don't know how you do this
you don't even know you are doing
are you do it quickly
and instinctively
so much of our dated a life
can be done on consciously
bomb
there are different activity you can do
driving
chewing gum shoe lace time
where if you're good enough asked them to export enough happen
you'll know you're doing
i was at a party a few years ago a friend of mine and we ran out of
food
so's at all does go pick ups
an hour later he was gone
still don's around warner
anne
we call upon itself all
they said ole
i got on the highway and i drove to work
huh
it's like an hour when the gun i would admit that
and these
some virginity things
happen
bomb
all the time
maybe more surprising
freud insight
that are whites in this life
it
argued of factors
the bat
tom
we're not necessarily conscious of
has a lot of their support lot of intervals
from research
into social psychology
for example
i'm so red here's a here's one find focus
tom
if somebody goes through it terrible
initiation
to get into a club
the like the club more
you might think it like it last as people do terrible things up
but actually hazing is
illegal
whatever marko bleak successful
cool
bomb
the more you pay for something the more you like it
and i'm warp mean you go through
get something
the more you like it
ah
from the standpoint of political politics for instance
tom
if you if you want loyal people in a political campaign
do not pay them
if you pay them to like us
if a volunteer
the like you
more
and we'll talk of a long
there is worldwide
but my point right now is simply
i'm
that
people known as serving notice
still
subject to this
another example
and some we're studies done
in a discipline of social psychology known as
there are managed
tom
which involves
so the middle death
the idea of supplement that france is this you sign up for human subjects require
and then you on
they put in front of the computer screen
and then they tell you what is set for computers been a watson question
and then the questions come out and are questions like
how much you love your country
what do you think of asians
what in the jews waving of blacks
they vegetarian with enable political views
different
here's the game at what you don't now is on that computer screen
words are being flat
if
but that
but again flap so fast that looks like like that
you don't see anything
words like corpse
dec
don
oh
the flashing of the sub little words so women all
meaning of france intermediate
below the level of consciousness
don't know we're seeing them
as dramatic effect on how you answer those questions
people exposed to death crime
ah
be calm
more nationalist it
more patriotic
less
forgiving of other people
less liking of other races
from other countries
again
the clay destination for why this is so something would forget to him
the point now simply the illustrate
that the sort of things can happen
things you aren't aware of
can have an effect
on how you i think
final example of give you this
it is
a short demonstration
ah
did this and that the class in half
so you'll be on this side of class
the right side my right
in this again website
and i simply want
everybody
to think about somebody you love
so there was only love
your friend your boyfriend mom
you dad
they give us some are you up just
shh
that
now
oh yes please vanity instructions
but i why give instructions to this happen last
i'm as everybody in this have left the seeded for your editor of your eyes
hey
teaching fellows dope
and everybody in this half
okay
a
okay there we read that
okay
now
to hear that
now
this roof look at this
and take a moment
you don't have to do it on paper
the take a moment
to do in your head
you made a patent struck some people might see both instructors follow the instructions you got for you
now this was we searched the bat
by nor work schwartz
and
here's a question i want to ask yourself
how much fuel like this person
and here's the backpack with you
restless
of the purse
half of you were asked list
finding which is not possible fine
is that liking goes op
in the three group
and liking goes down
andrew
and here's why
i had to think about town
three positive features
oh bob
of
somebody
so i then i go over and over and in the word
oh she's smart
beautiful and she's gone
good
how much of what a
well i think over
pretty good smart new whereby at
but the problem now schwartz is clever though
he says
this doesn't it get
some are beautiful klein
really nice good cook
uh-huh
i jewel
beef
smart
no i mention that
the problem is
nobody has ten positively
and then the
the enough
people wanting this bar
and then
those be when asked
how much
you like this occurs
on say
could really make it that pen
i guess i don't like them or
that atlantis illustration again
is that
the it shows a
you don't know lives
subject to poor aspin and possibly features
in and later ranked a person lower
and then ask why didn't you write a person lower
don't say it
could you told list han
typically we are oblivious
the factors that change
our points
but what we like to what we just like
and this is in fact
a substantial important part
of the study of psychology
and the cheerfully for instance
steady
of racial and sexual prejudiced
we're wanted a big finding some social psychology want to vote
almost entire lecture to this
people
strong views about other races
ah
that they don't know what
and that they don't know
control
their actions
so the cement stands
this rounds out
for to some extent
bomb
the particulars of freud
are for the most part
have been rejected
but the general idea of freud
is actually been so six
both in the study of scientific psychology
then in aren't herbert agent everyday life
that to some extent roy's been a victim of a zones
we tend to
to
on your estimate
then importance of forty in bought in everyday life
ah
because he's transfer
warmed our world view
the session extends
that is difficult for us to remember there's any other way
so to some extent
he's been the victim of a solves it
we have time for op
some further questions about freud and but scientific
i did a class wants
on had teach malice graduates did
and i just remember two things from this class
one thing isn't never raid and read them
was it people don't like that
the second thing is
never asked
any question
because who is very frightening to any question
people find it's intimidate
as was asked
what are your question
so
what are your question
and that
type
if royal even
medication
clinton had ended it did it's a good question ah
question was dispute freud will even medication
medication of course being a major thing
about revealed certain disorders now
but it would depression and anxiety
i'm on the one hand
freud made it starts under a sign
freud
today the mind in the brain
and was intensely interested
in
the neural
basis
of thought behavior
but that's her question and is now
although freud was very sensitive brain bases of behavior
freud was fully convinced
but the method through which to cure disorders like
would not be medication
ah
but rather through the sort of talk therapy
any insight
moreover modern psycho out
and
modern
therapist including some people want
psycho one would ugly ow
the fine
i will say well
these drugs are all well and good woody do with the mask
so if you have panic attacks
sec
it's true the drugs might make a panic attacks go way
and that's original and a real problem
and i make him go away you don't get a bigger problem
so dancers both freud and modern day psycho i was
they get medications
eventually all reviews and cream
yes
hi
the question is what a research on dreams
it means is such a fond papa
ah
that i wanted to vote kappa clasped
ting intrigued
so for instance i will answer the question
what is the most common tree
i will also answer the question who things about sex morning
man or what
and what proportion of
so a great questions i want
dreams what freud in standpoint
ah
there's been some evidence
that means do in some often do
tom
relationship to what you're thinking about when we're in the boat to the day
but the straw freud in view of symbolism
and wish for film
has not been supported by the study
what are your other question
yes whoever it is
her buffer
yes
the latter complex
the letter complex
is
the penis and the story
ah
floyd develop this is this is a this is a crude summary
but freud develop annabelle complex
you know
mom i love mom i bet
and that it's as if somebody reminded him
sit in there also women
if only at
and that's storage told you what the p. misses
and a penis envy and a replacement
is observe a very short version
i think it's fair to say that electorate complex was
a sort of pap ow
to the main
interest affordable what's
ah one more please
you
according to freud dom
that that
it is not assist extinction in the station the same senses immoral or a
but yes
claim that freud would make is
that the woman's discovery
she lacks
penis
plays a fundamental roll later on
the terminate her allegiance is like
from sexual preferences
so's not to sort of thing that affects or
period
