this is where my favorite topics in the course
food
agriculture
and die and and deeply interested in in the everybody's personal content connection to food
i'm
your were to review our were to breathe your we drink
and we often don't every good
understanding
of what sarah food what's miller what's no water
so hopefully this will sense it ties you to
problem
ah and also to get you to understand hopefully
of the structure of us normal law
prize to food in agriculture
this isn't it interesting area law

food like plastics
like energy
it really does not have a distinctive
our specific body of law that applies to it
as opposed to air
and water
of or pesticides
so that's kind of curious
problem that cuts across many differing areas many different fda types of regulation
ah and
the management of food
in the us
the management agriculture
is really fractured among a number of agents
great britain route recently central eyes their regulatory programme
and data created a single agencies to
of manage food
hi will think about to the wisdom of doing that
and some of the strengths and weaknesses
of the leah european british system
set a began a what you think about
ten into the world
that
caa is used to grow crops
order grace lives
livestock
to their thirty billion acres
of land in the world in about four billion acres of those
on cropland
to roughly bout to one seven thorough one eighth
the wall
tissues to grow crops
within the united states
it's about four hundred million acres of land
to enormous vary
first increasingly
in them more remote areas
as cities grow
as suburbs brawl
and as i farmers are pushed further overweight
and as has set really interesting important occasions for environmental quality
and also for human health
to your for crops represented
these pictures
how weak the upper left
a core
ah
many probably are aware that john a daily basis
so s consumed cotton
a into a variety of foods without recognizing it
in the no i in what form
soil
cotton siegel
part of that many peace trees
how many different kinds of sir ills
so the money parades the rely on
patsy oil
and in the bottom bryce these are for major greens in the world
that led to
ah ah ah
epa hundreds of millions of acres
of landscape
coral lonely night states is almost eighty million acres that that is caa
planet
increasingly
ah in united states farm sizes increasing
meaning that there are fewer and fewer farmers
and that surprisingly the diversity of crops that are planted and individual farms is also going down
so what that means is that farming is becoming more highly specialized
of that to a
farmers are knowledgeable about plsc
they
i have
last capacity to
of manage
problems which is a pass
of on died
i insects
of different sorts
because a really don't have that before no understanding of apology that many farmers
had they have in order to survive
in a world of that to was not as chem ugly dependent as
as ours is
kern industrialized agriculture
could be successful
ah on a parking lot
brought in soil
brought in fertilizer new bride in water
and the artificially yeah
on added debt organic matter
uh so basically the more you control your environment to using
industrial technology
the morgue spencer that becomes
ah but the less you have to worry about
understanding a college
so it's it's curious that to
i know as senseless nations
heard
in ownership patterns the farms got larger that the cropland specially
diminished
dr turn patterns of fallen simpson were pattern
we've relied on
fewer and fewer crops
so now that to most people's died is comprised of a between thirty to forty different
to individual crops
so i talked today about to what the central problems in food in agriculture are
i in these include food availability
and i think that most of us understand that there the
the role of government is often been perceived as one of trying to make sure that we have
productive
food supply
ah but that are agriculture says productive is it is a possibly could be
so we can maxim eyes our exports to other countries
so that our balance of trade would be helpful losses so we could deal with
wonder nor stun impoverished parts the world
they did not have the capacity to grow food for whatever reason
food prices are going up
delay in the last decade the they've shut taken up an increasing percentage
of the average household income
i mean the people are
all looking to buy
lower cost foods
the lower cost foods are often hire calories foods
are often foods are coming ban ball packages
list of people a are more prone to
by a of a book leave me out
a leader ny hap bottles a soda than they would the individual kids
on that had has had an influence on patterns of food consumption
to mention species dependence is gone
down were lying of fewer and fewer crops
i'll were genetically engineered rios crops
more and more
a very high proportion of foreign this plane the night states is no genetically engineered
of the same goes for the other major
grains we produce
also a serious problem we have is that job market are taste are being cultivated by
other organization
our critically food processor is
of that to our are any ingredients that we don't really pay much attention to
in terms of fat
furans assault
in terms of of of sugar
i of roddy or official flavors in collars that to
heidi due
a very
surveys
understand
kinds of taste what kinds of callers will kinds of flavors
full enjoy them out
use the example of the s elmo fan
us so that same in a step color didn't thirty to thirty five to thirty six different shades
are all ranging from a really deeper it today at
of vary like coral
so they made the dead their focus groups and
conducted surveys have figured out that
to most people like that number
thirty three
i so that dad that type of thinking
for beating the food industry
ah
we is virus
a tender spot
how we respond by
by a at a basically
out looking for the lower cost foods but also those that
to
i seem to to provide
either a
ah taste or
george some other
i aesthetic appeal
we also worker consuming more calories and we ever have
now we're consuming on average mean that states about thirty nine hundred calories per person
our only fifteen years ago we are consuming about to thirty two hundred calories
i'm that's up from
ah ah
perhaps a
twenty seven twenty eight hundred calories per person
in the average a person with the average wait
i sale a hundred and sixty five pound to mail
survive extremely well upon a dive about twenty four hundred calories per day
this would vary
commanders liane of some of your athletes
awesome of u m a raw now ten miles a day some you may swing
five miles a day
arata those of you that the to exercise a great deal
lani sling the to a much more
a much
higher cork intake
but that
combine knowledge about to what's happened to our behavior in our
julie century lie styles
ah sitting behind computers watching video games the latest report came out the one last week
demonstrating the kids are now spinning seven
hours a day
a looking electronic of quid and once one form or another
ah this is really quite striking

my generation we had that we intelligence
but saying on tv wasn't that big a thing riker up
and that we've missed the whole lot more time outdoors
time indoors
other night to
burning up
as much
energy is a use to
ah so whirl putting awake
water consumption
a water consumption especially in europe words the world
i irrigation not necessary for agriculture this is a critical problem
bill you related to climate change
our which
i is
causing experts to predict that
data
it's going to be increasingly expensive to move water into dry or
ah environment
meaning it's in the work
for requirement or shipped those
foods
for longer distances
a demanding higher energy
most of us don't really have much knowledge of the energy it takes to produce
isaiah
a bowl of peace is opposed to bold mail
ah or a at a stake
curious
came out of energy
ah that obviously increases with that distance from
of the source of production to the source of consumption
papa we really know pena tension of that we don't have any way of
of
measuring
by the way would be a terrific term paper somebody still thinking about or or serge topic for the course
one food
i just take apples
figure out where apples are are produced in the world
i'll figure out that
ah where yell buys it samples
and for that come up with
on that trick
for the energy involvement in moving and apple
ah from point a production to two point consumption
so you know you you could imagine a society at decades in of the future
our where you could take your eye phony to walk up for grocery store shelf
and year you could hold to the other part food on the food
are on the side of the shelf next your phone
and you could call up information on how were the food came from
are you could confirmation on it's energy
how was it produced using artificial chemicals
ah were owl kind fertilizers work were used to produce
so that we could get a hold new on
i'm level of understanding
of energy and and daddy environmental health of
a different products
including
of fat content type of fat
tom assaulted cetera
right now up most of us walked through the marketplace
really blinds to these issues
winds to of the environmental effects of food production
ah blinds also to the energy consumption
we also have very little understanding of food processing i want to think about a couple of commodities that you experience a routine basis
cotton for example that judges should you picture
cotton
is
n.'s not of kahn caesar put into a
a machine
i their ground out than there are are spray virus solvent
sold in extract the oils
are new oil drifts down into into bats
hi gets mixed with other kinds vegetable oils
finance its way
our winds its way into into supermarket
how bout de grace
oh great set have water extracted from them
hi and they're turned into reasons
cobb ii can think of a variety of different foods corner as another example
ah willis extracted from court how is it
done it's done using a solvent
what happens to the solvent were to seek our their residue service
paul and in in corn oil
and answers often yes the reserve use do that
ah persisted you get into into the food supply
papa we have very little understanding of what happens to food
what weeks the farm
on it's way too at
for dinner table
packaging is a topic that will take on a few weeks
billy with respect plastics
in the at the absence of our our understanding the
be a origin of the plastic
the plastic the initiated takes to produce a plastic
is really quite striking
all the plastic waste hmta des surrounds most of the
the needs that are produced unavailable in grocery stores
throw away
there's almost no hope that any that plastic use of recycle
it's simply discarded nuts burned
ah and many the plastics contain chemicals a human we don't water brief
or it the buried in land fills
on the will lead to break out gradually they will leech into soil signal i water sup
flies
hi and as a mentioning earlier lecture
in every way and fill
ah long of the three hundred thousand exists in the nation
fined these resumes of plastic and soil
in the underlying
ground water supply
silly they became farmer wallet health problems associated with our methods of food production
i include pesticides
and all talk a bit about pesticides said today in the structure pesticide law
and there now
the some
twenty five thousand pesticides
that are or are
packaged in different ways and sold different combinations in united states alone
in the world marketplace their seventy five thousand
products
other than registered by different nations
how bout fertilizers
oh some parts the world human waste is uses for watchers am always tissues
but also
ah there are
fossil fuel based
ah fertilizers there are
for
very common
so increasingly how we find
fertilizers
of being used
farmers

to newly planted reply at the same field they don't what a lot led a life our
ah they don't plant crops that can fixed
on nitrogen into the soil
so that delay after they act added artificially
coloring agents
ah most to you probably do not pay too much attention to coloring agents in the food
africa is a very interesting history of of
coloring agents
and differing nations have different laws
and some people some these agents are natural
others are artificial
i have looked at
that'll be another great paper topic just take it

a outlook
kuwait
to what we know about that different kinds of of chemicals are used
color foods
flavors also
official flavors in natural flavors
a we know about them
ah the the do not have to be labeled under federal food law
ah so natural flavors is up
a un umbrella category
and artificial flavors also is
and that is is it a huge industry
he decided he wanted to produce a ia new coke auction review would be a coconut flavored that
i apple sauce
worry you could basically get to
on some sort of pure read for it
bob different sorts may be pierre maybe apple maybe peaches
the ground and crime paul pop
and that by processing it you've likely lose all flavor
figure out how to put the flavor back into
well you could do that really is easily ag encouraging go online
the at
international fqpa
flavors and fragrance is institute
hi and it will give you a list of firms chemical companies all over the world that will allow you to say yes i want to let me make a act
lima
apple sauce story yet
a root beer flavored chewing to
caa they will ddt and leah
cable companies name in and they will provide you with the the essence is nasa's
terry
to creep
product
also you may not know but a fragrance is are commonly used in food because fragrance is will trigger the same
nerve response
hi in your mouth and in your mind
that the flavors will trigger
so to a creek a sense a trick eating as a whoop your flavored the oatmeal
i had
please a
a drop of
of of fragrance said to give you that impression
packaging materials processing effects
to nation of here water and food
i'm genetic modification these are all
a highly debated topics
all around the world
given the fact that to many nations have different standards
how were as the marketplace the global marketplace
clearly uses a
of moving out commodities at the lightning pace across national boundaries
creating
seriously though problems
ah for firms that to have to understand
of the the difficulty of the difficult to
ah problem of of having different the regulations
i in different countries
in their deeper law deeper problems here
associate with the food supply
i'm a include that
really are fractured legal in in regulatory responsibility
i'll talk more about that in a few moments
private science
ah the fact that the majority of science that and allies
ah understanding the
the ia environmental of facts
the health effects by the energy consumption
wired in order to produce in the food
and the
the energy required to let to do with a waste
the science is being conducted in the private sector it's often not available to the public sector
trade secrecy laws impotent
is it
quite important in this case
i in that addict often prevents you from understanding
in that detail
she really need to know in order take control of your own diet
worker safety is another deeper problem that we don't pay much attention to
if you look at that the or the for the farm worker poisoning data
becomes apparent that to
fda workers are often
not well protected
they're often
ah
not monitored
they often do not have law
i assurance intend to
ah health care
us so that the
it's a neglected population
migrant workers at traditionally been exploited in almost every nation the world
ban but even in our
for we think we have highly sophisticated law
our workers really are not protected
i nearly the same as you or i would be
so that there different standards for allow bore rest
for workers
hmta there are for
for a eu arise sake
food in in the marketplace
has different contamination limits
how
another deeper problem is the narrative advantage of the producers
you look at the scale of the advertising industry in their their methods of advertising must also be a great topic for paper
and where there were there tom a dominant a strategies
i hmta they make
claims of a product benefit
either that it is natural
other does health full
how far can they go or what was restrict what they can claim
what about their requirements to
a disclose risks that they're known
to be associated with
whither foods
to sell its it's interstate
annette that you're getting food industry a vault
basically how growing from a strategy that
fda huh
playing said
a certain classic chemicals is not
present in the food supply
so synthetic
are organic pesticides are not allowed to be years
a in in organic foods
now that doesn't mean that those are producing
not organic foods have to label what
can it chemicals are in their food
about different legal strategy sunlight employed
ah in order to provide the consumer with knowledge that we really necessary
to understand
the reading


public subsidies also ah are all a worthy
ah topic
for somebody interested in trying to to transform the
the at international food system
so if you
ah
look at the subsidies carefully ny can do this now because there's a group in washington called the environmental working group
together terrific website
ah so you can go due to a the website new confine your home state
in your counting your or your town
figure out which farmers are getting which subsidies
time what to say is that
to
industrialized dec commodities such as corn and wheat and cotton
but there are seen the balkans subsidies in the nation
ah
as opposed to the organic farmers war or
farmers there beyond organic
who based lucy no subsidies
so that that no government funds could be used to to
in of a tutoring transform
ah the structure of of agricultural nation
that
this is not likely
in the near future
i'll land values
how land i use play into the pattern of farming in agriculture that that we currently say
well no eu which
what i suggested earlier in the tacos that to happen those urban areas and suburban areas
crawl out into on develop lands
calmly
will
uh-huh cause property guy use
in lands that are nearby
ah to increase
of the commercial value their there're a residential value of or their industrial value
of may shoot up
glee as a
as a city expands
us so that the the value of the of the land
from the
and terms of its productivity for
different crops often king compete with this rising that
ah property value
i said that that the farmer sells out
also the
to way and
flat generally
by it also is
use a
i'm not force did
and what this means is that that it's really easy develop
so you can write in the at a prom of of developing that
force areas
ah it's much more expensive for landed on
so you find a the rate of transformation of farm land
ah from
from
especially in the
roll part two us
that to
or in the target zone for urban expansion
of these lands are are being
i shifted into into residential and commercial use of worry rapid rate
so come
ah
the fundamental problem i think we face right now is is one of intelligence
i don't mean to imply that that it's absence of capacity
to understand these things
it's an absence of producing the knowledge and making it publicly exceptional to consumers
in a way that there really couldn't power you to
you out we act in the marketplace
in a way that was send messages back to corporations
a messages that i think that really
are often much more powerful
and that often
more listens to
ah then messages sent by regulators
i'm
and that like you think cap
ah
about corn and a methyl for just a moment
and gather the increasing subsidy for
of the production of death and all
ah that diet
a no blocks jeannie fuels
i'm in that is
he's a choir by a at a different levels of government including the informal protection agency
come
as a way of improving your quality
hi
data what is increasingly parent
is that data
of the f. in all
the subsidy is caused
a corn prices
ah to rise quite dramatically
ah but does
more the of farmers are are putting these ethel production plants
on their property
and there are not show me foreign into the food supply
ah
now there also was and pop and over abundance of enthusiasm among the farmers to
reduced the f. and all
this so
the ethel market to
target the collapse
and this is yes
farmers a throughout the united states
now about to one area and of the eerie of
go application
critically pesticides
this is an interesting year a unattended
demands itchy think about
a real variety of loss
august
federal food drug and cosmetic act
here
federal insecticide fungicide rodenticide
on the food quality protection act
these are the dominant statutes in the act states that apply to
sighed the
ah control
well but other laws as well
are necessary to understand
and have some
the some control over
pesticides including the safe drinking water act
on other words the
one would need to worry about that the application of
billions of house of pesticides in united states every year
ah because pesticides often don't just go away
they they often will move down through soil son into ground water sup
flies
and so while we talk a bit to later in the
in the of the week
about that the problem managing of drinking water quality
by the way the government to
i is food in take surveys
concludes that
number one food that everybody sending that states
i is water
water is classified as a food under the food drug and cosmetic act
ah and so they
a worrying about to water contamination is really important issue
and understanding
of the way that to chemical release into the atmosphere is well as into
ah on plants in into the
ah the landscape
that
family drinking water
even if it goes through a filth ration plant
ah but to
and is a case for many urban or
resource conservation recovery act
of the we talked a bit about last week in superfund
most of the sites have pesticides within them
and they are
classified as
pesticides in part because of pesticides that are there
pesticides were in the
our rcra sites in the cercla sights on be a case

anomaly at chemicals it's our persistent were replied
thirties forties and fifties
hello
toxic sessions control act
ah does deal with pesticides
the hazardous material
hans british enact does as well
national normal policy acted that we talked about last week
endangered species act
you have a endangered species
that to
and it's habit has been defined
it said normally illegal to apply pesticides
i in that and that habitat
all the wilderness act would prevent pesticides from being applied
a with its boundaries
and the manufacturer pesticides often
look
produces at airborne resumes
ah that are regulated and a clean air act
ah and also the release
a via pipes
from those plants
papa
is regulating the clean water act
caa blood
as well
ah come
can that madge in the problem of
brain
chemicals
year after year a landscape
ah and then now you have a rain storms coming in the spring
he be good example of that actors lunches and herbicides
pre emerging herbicides so they plant the corn before the corn strauss
worry the landscape with the act three scene
often in the spray
so and always in the spring actually
early in the midwest
after the spring rains come
can measures spikes in act three scene in the mississippi river
and most mid western rivers
these rivers and the midwest provide water supplies for tens of millions of people
ah in the folks ration of the plants will not take it out
so both the clean water act was safe for drinking water act command
why in that case
any occupation safety and health
act
also is designed to protect
joe worker safety
ah but as i said earlier
but often set standards that are far above standards are
are raw
set for
of non worker environment
so it's a very complicated body of law
to for this reason pesticides becomes a good
good window to to understand law
ah
one way to think about this is that
it's driven by
things really
one is that
sides are
they're not to they're not like us into some new chemical was somebody designs
i know for a
to be added to the plastic to make it stronger
that wasn't designed
tuzla
kill a difference species
designed to the
right some function alley
ah but pesticides g group of chemicals
a were specifically designed to
injured
your plan
ah hah an insect
some other species
fact some of the nerve gas is that we're designed to a during war war to an end to
ah in the nineteen twenties by great britain in in that germany
i'm not to germany
they were designed specifically to armed ailments
and many these nerve gas is it then that deluded down
of for agricultural purposes
so that all species upton targets
ah for the development to wisconsin last night
to number one their intensely toxic sentences
a number to to get their of fact
gotta be released to the environment
quantities
so you release a chemical environment
ii
in the atomic weapons testing
st
tells us you parent understand so you got work out
and that pesticide history is for plead with
examples where
a dead too little attention
now i want to loss step back
and dec take you
to the earlier part
of the century
i want to think about that
a very serious problem
paul at that point time than in the prom that persistent and that's malaria
malaria is a
and illness it's transmitted by parasite
hi
to
via an awful these mosquito end up all of its
all of its of areas
at
had the capacity
to
parasite op
from the blood
all the infected the animal are at effective human
so
fat if you had malaria
in an insect humiliated that new
ah
enough lease mosquito would first spit a little bit of money anti quite north
boss this into your
in here a body
to act i help you believe little bit
i met with sack
your blood
i into it's still the cavity
i in with that blood they would
colin
malaria parasite suitor your body
perhaps app i didn't evst
to my didn't have malaria
that mosquito flew over and when that meat
thought they would like meat
and that when it would in circuits
anti quite human
god inerts saliva in the
they would transmit parasites into my body that's the way that this
illnesses transmitted from person persons
i
parasite that
ah has a capacity to live for nine to leveling days inside the body rooms
he of the sick other than interesting
i teach you that that daddy encephalitis virus last from ten to twenty five days
and data bank god the aids virus
alas only want a today's
so that the be out long charity of of different viruses are backed
syria or
parasite
ny inside different in insects
a fax food of the rita transmission
i wanted to also understand that the scale of this problem a world
today there about to between
three hundred and five hundred million people
ah better clinically disabled by malaria meaning that they what they're walking around with this parasite their bodies
caa the satin them of energy that is giving and curry act
years
ah that to make some more susceptible other kinds of illnesses
caa and forty percent a worlds population live in areas that that are at risk
meaning that the mosquitoes in that area
capable of transmitting the parasite
and you got a large population percentage that to
ah also was curing the the parasite their bodies
the and the core the prom for malaria in the world is is really got in tropical region since and that
billion africa
where ninety percent of the incidence mortality
i exist
and i the vs in the right now by the world health organization is the raw we want to warn app million people die every year from malaria
on and the estimate
over the twentieth century is about a hundred million people
ah have died from the stillness
unit mo many people i have not understood the scale of this problem
so hmta it's
it's also clear a few are read much military history
that to malaria was a a very serious problem in him
all wars
us so that if you go back to other time of
ah hah napoleon
are few a look at the
ia ah history war with one
or will were to as
this us sore other countries moved into tropical parts the world
of more casualties calmly occurred more loss days
ah among the ammonia
she eyes
kurt
adieu to malaria it did to the direct effects of cash
they're also susceptible populations kids in endemic areas that
ah although in epidemics all age groups are affected
a refugees and migrant populations in those living in tents searches by those are
are of fighting in the
armed conflict
hi it's all related to heightened exposure being
it out in environment where
tonight year you're still yourself being bitten by affected
i insects
so you could also madge in the dead those that that to work in
in not mine sore those that are working for stream tropical parts the world or
or agricultural workers
they are also more rest
he was banned
time out to outdoors and prophets
i in the in endemic curious
are more risk
as are those with reduced immunity
who s reduced immunity
pregnant women
pregnant women are extremely susceptible to a very serious illness from from pregnancy and and and also miscarriage is
a
also that the very young young children
are those that all already have their immune system compromised
for in parts of of ahh
to the poorest parts the world
are you often have the
ground
hi incidence of
ah
she respiratory infections are dire real diseases
the reduces that
strength in immunity
and makes one more susceptible to to of the selves
awarded away so controlling malaria
besides
and then there's a of example of worker
in nineteen thirty nine in outbreak caa in in natal brazil
when that
a at the mosquito actually hitch bikes
of from africa on a male boat
ah
an awful use the in be a mosquito out not
not that
indigenous to to
you brazil
so they they finally figured out that hitch hiking on this mill freighter
ah was able to
two out of our or a number of them did
and they were able to establish a at
during a large and robust population that occurred during a rainy season when
ah they had exactly the right
eu wall all water steaming i'm
on the areas set
so mosquitoes have actually are adjusting in the paper for
ah streams or rivers are moving really quickly as habitat
others like every still water
others like shallow water
us so that the their hundreds and hundreds different species of of mosquitoes capable
about transmitting
of these these illnesses touches muller a. or dainty fever or yellow fever
thus if understanding the apology
here is really important
ah
one way of dealing with
of the problem and not understanding the college e
basically to
please spray brought areas where escape with with pesticides which is what they did this case
ah
but when u. s. troops invaded
ah
islands in the pacific in the in the a war against to japan
i in the mid nineteen forties
the incidence
along now us g eyes was often
thousand per thousand for years it was reported
meaning that everybody on the island had on average
ah malaria at least
canned the rates here
cause and have to move troops now in the island much more rapidly than they normally would have

the
fda velma the chlorine industry
hi is a very important part of the story because
chlorine is a kochi component
many pesticides were developed in the nineteen forties
ah including ddt
according hydrocarbons
ah include
ah aldrin dieldrin kept a core chlordane
goals
curiously the became the target of the normal protection agency
as soon as it was formed in the nineteen seventy
fda why's that
well because
all the properties that need stretching ninety
ah dangerous compound
persisted
ah it
moved widely through the in farmer
he would come plsc contaminated richly every compartment
ah and it would build upton food chain spring food change as well as
this have any caa systems
ah and actress shirley persistence
they would get in people's bodies
there would be transmitted to
by breast milk across generations
so to the
the at
a search was on
during this explosion in the chemical industry in the nineteen forties
for variety new chemicals ww replace the older
maddox
paris green
in the previous shot
here
this gel menace mixing paris green witches is arsenic
he's mixing it by hand esa based is throwing out across us
i'm
so that the the heavy metals use earlier in the century were placed by the cornered hydrocarbons
up and
ah
gradually they figured out that said ddt in particular was exceptionally effective a controlling the paris of the yep
insects who would transmit the parasite
ah that that is malaria
causes malaria

so this was first tried
i as refugees moved to europe during world war two
and here's an example of taking out basically a very of a bicycle pump
whos in
endemic
the drill that was followed was
other was one shot down the back of the neck
there was one shot shutdown of the
the we stand and then up into a the lower part of the shirt
come back
ah and then koppel food conflict
so that tens of thousands of people were lined up in rome
walking through the stations
as people about work were sanitation workers and
how would based billion these pumps and spray people
this attempts a brought the typhus epidemic
a
this transmitted by by please
to about clothes
truly rapidly within a matter of a couple weeks
what was anticipated to
to of gone for four months if not years
another example of child at the time being spraying
so gradually added they recognize the ddt would kill sully different species
ah but it was sprayed across marsh grandson and landscapes
and they realized that the in the world were too that they should also lisa friend cultural purposes
so by nineteen fifty
ddt was being market in
i as a at
give way to control law passed that would threaten
to bought every crockett could imagine
more than three hundred different crops
ah critical components of us agriculture
all were recommended be to be treated by by the single camel
so ddt is good for me
others will jingle of one along with us that the kids would say
there was no understanding of of itself by looking malaysian capacity
by even though they understood that they are at the spray it wants an area
ah i were as other compounds they would have to come come back and keep on spraying
so of
ah tell that story in just a moment
here's another example of jones beach in new york
how where they the county ia was public health department
driving down the beach
and that
of the sign is on the sad destructive distraught he can't read ensure that
telling
says that ddt
par for insecticide
harmless to humans
the burr though understanding of
they were doing
kids we're running down that people unit hamburgers
todd trucks would come by kids of the city a picnic tables
table all of food and endemic kids include be spraying
very little understanding of
the basic the college e of this compound
i sell it persistence soil
it was later discovered ten to thirty five years
in any atmosphere
three years
to suicide
ah they decided the richest
the year just by chance be said well you know this is a ridiculous thing to do
about to thirty meters off the ocean
on a freighter
wait between stephens is going tokyo
they took
your measurements and found that the ddt was present in the year
and a little the pacific ocean
that there was a latitude no great
green
so this eu probes picnic waiter
a higher concentration ddt
on the if you move away
no i was that
was because of the ia increased number of passage you get closer the queer in tropical ports the world
all led those nations to spring were ddt
for
but also for crop protection purpose
it's also found in human tissues
ah and it probably is still detected when you're tissues
in fact it was looking at the food and drug administration set records
on pesticide residue use in the foods
why
striking that to
i even today
ddt use
is one of the most attractive chemicals in the us food supply particularly in milk products
i had very very low levels
but it's a good indicator of the the long term persistence of this compound
and why we need to pay attention to that
also not like strong chimp
did in breast milk
meaning that to if if you were breast fed
by your mom and probably had a higher concentration
ah to
and in the
i eu do but to any body greenwich you guys coming from
probably adjusted stores from year
your mom because his compound finds the body fat it's little philip
as opposed to hide who fell like
ah hand and
and to
that's the at
the way that to you be exposure grandmother probably had residue is far higher than that in your mother
furans generation will
ah of factors is quite curious
in nineteen seventy one
ah the effort to regulated was
was really pioneer by vermont
ah vermont passed a lot
ah being ddt use in the state
and they had formerly been spraying on their force to control for gypsy moths
of that i was followed
in that wisconsin
in nineteen seventy by by a and
in new york in nineteen seventy one
ah by a ban
finally
actually other british also left
i decided that the

it was not a problem that to
the e
for for agriculture in the control public health was so important
can you be years
we're esa soviets found that
ii was worthy of a ban
came out so strongly
ah in favor of a ban
finally in nineteen seventy two remember e. p. a. was created in nineteen sixty nine
i are actually
came into being in nineteen seventy
the nineteen seventy two
ah way raw calls house whos the former
administrator of of the rhyme updated
clean c.
decided they should move ahead
cause of the effects on wildlife
but also the leah
humans
kochi fell
was sick unit significant enough
to justify
for duration
and i know you can't read this but that
others in interesting
phrase cynicism leah
in york times
ah
to
to december of the thirty first nineteen seventy two
i mean tiny explain growers and cotton peanuts soy beans
other three crops account for almost a total domestic use of ddt
all will get instructions in the handling of a substitute pesticides
or a fire
the substitute years
i can't really recall
is non toxic
ah but i like ddt
i do great
god quickly
so they're trading off
persistent chemical
ah a for one the degrees quite quickly
not really understanding what the long term effect might be
the
curiously
bernie the manufacturer companies that manufacture ddt
todd said
themselves
or you know sir way that we could to modify the chemical structure of the compound
ah and sept sell something that would be a minor vary
by and they produced a compound is known as dyke a fall
ah that was
only a little bit different
and that loan behold
all in all parts the country
out where dyke a fall was sprayed
found similar facts are wildlife
plea among a large rafters
a cell in the in the southwest were in the south ny were cotton is grown
founded being the found dyke a fall building up just a way ddt had
ah so it was little fill it
by cable news
and then that
basically

again equally worry simply rumble protection aids
it's a banned ddt in eighty two and seventy two
oddly got around to recognizing that to
ah
natalie was dyke a fall
having the same facts
it also was contaminated by ddt a level about fifteen percent
and that they needed to get that that chemical outta foods
flies is ban and out of the yep
ah and farmers well
so it took until nineteen eighty six for them to actually
move ahead with a regulation
and then to work its way out of production took until the early nineteen nineties
so
this is the ban that was in the ban
but that ban that took effect in seventy two it really was not effective until
of the early nineteen nineties
now if you than jump ahead fast court's nineteen ninety nine
why you see that e. p. a. is getting around to studying
methyl parathion on
the recommended subs a to but we marcos house in nineteen seventy two
i be decided pablo for nineteen ninety nine
he decided this chemical
as more dangerous than we thought
times responsible for more for worker des in poisoning than any other chemical in history
not only is it to
far more truly toxic than ddt
but
upton
to
also persistent longer than they believed
so i
one of the at concerns we have today is
i know where we going to do with
to
persistence of malaria
ah but also it's likely migration
into parts of the world to
where it data ban well control
if you look at that where malaria
i exist now
see it that that
malaria is a problem for to win the tropical
words the world also the poorest parts of the world
ah and you'll see that to
to range of malaria
of the different a species mosquito secure it
it it's widening its
widening right now in response to
fewer changing climb medic conditions
so the habitat is becoming more favorable for disease transmission
now the world health organization a recognize this and they called together group of of people that to
for pesticides and i worker pesticides for media
ah fifteen years
and work with a group about tess seven other people
awesome from african nations
fda tread understand how to manage malaria critically in africa
fda be waco had gone along with the bans of e. p. a. in most other high income nations in the world
and had faced about it did not recommend the use of ddt
in any part the world
has of the mid nineteen seventies
they want to reconsider this because a was so expensive that was so
it was so effective
in part because it was so persistent
they realize that it was sprayed both indoors and outdoors
cause
the insects to of all resistant strains
on that would be harder and harder for them to manage
hi
fact many mosquitoes have developed or resistance to to
i ddt
so that they spray it on a wall inside a house
ah the
i'm not police mosquito when i'm a wall
could sense it through its feet
and they would take off
that that's and solace a new behave or responsive
to prevented it from absorbing a lethal dose
so i'm gradually have the world health organization the became the
turned about
increasing not incidence of malaria
billion africa
ah and the convened this group to to try to figure out with or not it made sense
ah to
to get behind god ddt in into to
i use it again
and that the next most effective pesticide
cost four times the level
of ddt
ah so this is a problem
and that the the eighty agencies were not willing to pay this increased expense
so that
that
a debbie wait show
bob finely in two thousand six
i gave
ddt a clean bill of health
so to speak
but even though this group of experts a bit to hide convened in in two thousand four

found that
well no abusing ddt is really not a good idea
she use alas
paul one that is less persistent
odd that would be equally effective
but even though it cost more so it's a matter of finding the money
in order to pay for
law that would protect human health
ah come than that
a informal quality
the same time it would deal with a malaria problem
so hot i'm a time when to stop there
that will come back on thursday and take a closer look at the variety of laws
of that applied to
the nation
