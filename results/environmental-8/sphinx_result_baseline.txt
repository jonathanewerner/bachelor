this is where my favorite topics in the course
food
agriculture
and i am deeply interested in him that everybody's personal content connection the food
i'm
you are we to review our which breathe your we drink
and we often don't have a very good
understanding
bob what's in our food what center and what's no water
so hopefully this will sense it ties you to
problem
ah and also to get you to understand hopefully
ah the structure of us normal law
applies to food neck or culture
this isn't it interesting area law
ah
food like plastics
like energy
it really does not have a distinctive
our specific body of law that applies to it
as opposed to a year
and water
of or pesticides
so that's kind of curious
problem that cuts across many different areas many different types of regulation
ah and
the management of food
in the u. s.
the management agriculture
is really fractured among a number of asians
great britain route recently central eyes they're regulatory program
and that created a single agency to
hi manage fun
hi will think about the wisdom of doing that
and some of the strengths and weaknesses
of the leah european persist
so began a what you think about
ten into the world
that
it is used to grow crops
order grace lives
livestock
so there are thirty billion acres
of land in the world in about four billion acres of those
on crop land
to roughly back to one seven thorough one eighth
the wall
is used to grow crops
within the united states
it's about four hundred million acres of land
to the norma sir
first increasingly
in them more remote areas
as cities grow
as suburbs brawl
and as the farmers are pushed further and further away
this has said really interesting important occasions for informal quality
and also for human health
to care for crops represented
these pictures
how weak the upper left
a core
ah
many people we're aware that john a daily basis
to us consumed cotton
a into a variety of foods without recognizing it
in the no i in what form
oil
cotton siegel
part of that many peace trees
how many different kinds of sir ills
so the money parades that rely on
patsy oil
and in the bottom bryce these are for major greens in the world
that led to
ah ah ah
well hundreds of millions of acres
of landscape
cor alone the united states is almost eighty million acres that that is co
planet
increasingly
ah in united states farm size is increasing
meaning that there are fewer and fewer farmers
and that surprisingly the diversity of crops that are planted and individual farms is also going down
so what that means is that farming is becoming more highly specialized
of that that huh
farmers are knowledgeable about
they
i have
last capacity to
of managed
problems which is a pass
a von died
i insects
of difference wards
because it really don't have that before no understanding of apology that many farmers
had they have in order to survive
in a world of that joe was not as cam ugly dependent as
as ours is
kern industrialized agriculture
could be successful
ah on a parking lot
brought in soil
brought in fertilizer new bride in water
and the artificially yeah
a antidote organic matter
uh so basically the more you control your environment to using
industrial technology
the morgue spencer that the comes
ah but the less you have to worry about
understanding the college
so it's it's curious that to
i know as senseless asians
heard
in ownership patterns the farms got larger that the crop that specially
diminished
dad turn patterns of fallen simpson were pattern
we've relied on
fewer and fewer crops
so now that to most people's died is comprised of a between thirty to forty different
that individual crops
so i talked today about to what the social problems and food narrow culture are
ah annie's include food availability
and i think that most of us understand that debbie
the role of government is often been perceived as one of trying to make sure that we have
productive
food supply
ah but that our agriculture says productive is it is a possibly could be
so we can maxim eyes our exports to other countries
so that our balance of trade with the help of also so we could deal with
wonder nor stun impoverished parts of the world
they did not have the capacity to grow food for whatever reason
food prices are going up
two in the last decade the they've shut taken up an increasing percentage
of the average household income
i mean the people are
all looking to buy
a lower cost foods
the lower cost fruits are often hire towering fruits
broken through to come in and ball packages
so people are are more prone to
by am about leave me out
a leader in a hap follows a soda than they would the individual kids
on that had has had an influence on patterns of food consumption
to mention species dependence is gone
cod down were lying and fewer and fewer crops
i'll were genetically engineered rios crops
more and more
a very high proportion of porn this planet united states is now a genetically engineered
of the same goes for the other major out
grains we produce
also a serious problem we have is that job market are tastes are being called invaded by
other realization
our critically food processor is
hi that to our our any green's that we don't really pay much attention to
in terms of fat
terms assault
in terms of of of sugar
and roddy or official flavors in collars that
heidi due
a very
surveys
understand
kinds of space will kinds of callers will kinds of flavors
full enjoy them out
you see example of the yes elmo fan
uh so that salmon a step caller didn't thirty to thirty five to thirty six different shades
are all ranging from a really deep read today yeah
a very like quarrel
so they they did tether focus groups are
conducted surveys have figured out that
to most people like that number
thirty three
i so that dad that type of thinking
for beating the food industry
ah
we inspires
a tender spot
how we respond by
via out basically
out looking for the lower cost goods but also those that
dad
i seem to to provide
either a
ah taste warp
george mother
a aesthetic appeal
we also worker consuming more calories and we ever have
now we're consuming on average net states about thirty nine hundred calories per person
our only fifteen years ago we are consuming about ten thirty two hundred calories
i'm that's up from
ah ah
perhaps a
twenty seven twenty eight hundred calories per person
in the average a person with the average wait
i say a hundred and sixty five pound the mail
survive extremely well on a dive about twenty four hundred calories per day
this was very true
tremendously end of some of your athletes
some of us may run out ten miles a day some you may swing
five miles a day
ah to those of you that that to exercise a great deal
gladys li need to a much more
how much
higher cork intake
but that
combine knowledge about to what's happened to our behavior an hour
julie century lie styles
ah sitting behind computers watching video games the latest report came out the one last week
demonstrating the kids are now spinning seven
hours a day
a looking electronic whitman once one form or another
ah this is really quite striking
a
my generation we had that we intelligence
but saying on tv wasn't that big a thing when i grew up
and that we've missed the whole lot more time outdoors
time indoors
other not to
burning up
as much
ah energies they used to
ah so whirl putting awake
water consumption
a water consumption especially airports the world
i irrigation not necessary for agricultural this is a critical problem
bill you related to climate change
our which
oh it is
causing experts to predict that
dad
it's going to be increasingly expensive to move water into dry or
ah environments
meaning it's been in the work
for requirement or ship those
shoes
for longer distances
a demanding higher energy
most of us don't really have much knowledge of the energy it takes to produce
i say ia
a bowl of peace is opposed to bowl of mail
ah or a at a stake
curious
came out of energy
ah that obviously increases with that distance from
ah the source of production to the source of consumption
ah but we really know paying attention to that we don't have any way up
of thought
measuring it
by the way would be a terrific term paper somebody still thinking about her search topic for the course
one food
i just take apples
figure out where apples are are produced in the world
i'll figure out that
ah aware yell bison samples
and for that come up with
on that trick
for the energy involvement in moving an apple
ah from point a production to two point consumption
so you know i you you could imagine a society at decades in the future
our where you could take your eye phony to walk up her grocery store shelf
india you could hold to the other bar code on the food
are on the side of the shelf next your phone
and you could call up information on how were the food came from
are you could called information on its energy
how was it produced using artificial chemicals
ah we're all kinds of true lies is we're we're used to produce
so that we could get a whole new odd
i'm level of understanding
of energy and daddy informal health of
a different products
pudding
the fact content type of fat
a lot of salt cetera
right now up most of us walked through the marketplace
really blind to these issues
winds to a dunbar more facts of food production
ah blinds also to the energy consumption
we also have very little understanding of food processing i want to think about a couple of commodities such huge various on a routine basis
cotton for example that judges should you picture
cotton
it is
n.'s not outcome caesar put into a
a machine
i they are ground up then there are our spray via solvent
sold in it's tracks the oils
our new oil drifts down into into bats
hi gets mixed with other kinds of vegetable oils
finance its way
our winds its way into into supermarket
how bout de grace
oh great set have water extracted from them
hi and they're turned into reasons
ah but i you can think of a variety of different foods corner as another example
ah willis extracted from court how is it
done it's done using a solvent
what happens to the solvent were to seek our they're residue service
all went in in corn oil
and answers often yes the reserve used to that
ah persisted you get into into the food supply
papa we have very little understanding of what happens to food
what weeks the farm
on its way to act
for dinner table
packaging is a topic that will take on a few weeks
billy with respect plastics
in the at the absence of our our understanding the
the origin of the plastic
the plastic the initiated takes to produce a plastic
is really quite striking
all the plastic wastes and that des surrounds most of that
the needs that are produced unavailable in grocery stores
throw away
there's almost no hope that any that plastic is every cycles
it's simply discarded nuts burned
ah and many a plastics contain chemicals are you really don't wanna brief
or if the buried in land fills
on the will lead to break out gradually they will be chen the soil so underlying waters
flies
and as a mentioning earlier lecture
in every way and fill
ah longer the three hundred thousand exists in the nation
find these resumes of plastic and soil
in the underlying
ground water supply
silly they became normal in health problems associated with our methods of food production
ah include pesticides
and all talk a bit about pesticide said today in the structure pesticide law
and there now
the sum
twenty five thousand pesticides
that are are are
packaged in different ways and sold different combinations in united states alone
in the world market place their seventy five thousand
products
other than registered by different nations
how bout fertilizer ers
and some parts of a world human waste is uses for allies ers animal waste tissues
but also
ah there are
fossil fuel based
ah fertilizer suitor
our
very common
so increasingly how we find
fertilizer
being used
farmers
out
to newly planted reply at the same field they don't let a lot letter life hour
ah they don't plant crops that can fixed
on nitrogen into the soil
ah so that today after they had entered officially
calling agents
ah most to you probably do not pay too much attention to corey agents in the food
ah but that is a very interesting history of of
calling agents
and different nations have different laws
and some people some easy use or natural
others are artificial
i have looked at
that'll be another great paper topic just take it
ah
a yeah a look
kuwait
to what we know about that different kinds of chemicals are used
caller foods
flavors also
official flavors in natural flavors
a woody know about them
ah baby do not have to be labeled under federal food lot
ah so natural flavors is up
a an umbrella category
an artificial flavors also is
and that is is it a huge industry
he decided he wanted to produce a ia a new coke auction maybe it would be a coconut flavored that
i apple sauce
were you could basically get that
on some sort of pure read for it
are all different sorts may be pierre maybe apple maybe peaches
the ground and crime the paul pop
and that by processing it you've likely lose all flavor
figure out how to put the flavor back into it
well you could do that really is easily ag encouraging go online
the yep
international ths
flavors and fragrance is institute
hi enable gave you a list of firms chemical companies all over the world that will allow you to say yes i want to let me make a eh
why not
pull saw sor ia
a root beer flavored chewing gum
hi they will give you dia leah
cable companies name them and they will provide you with the the essence is ness
terry
to creep
product
also you may not know but a fragrance is are commonly used in food because fragrance is will trigger the same
nerve response
caught in your mouth and in your mind
that the flavors will trigger
so to a create a sense a trick meeting as a root beer flavored the oatmeal
i had
please a
a drop of
of a fragrance said to give you that impression
getting materials processing of facts
taylor nation of here water and food
i inject modifications are all
a highly debated topics
all around the world
given the fact that to many nations have different standards
uh we're as the marketplace the global marketplace
clearly is is a
i'm moving out commodities at the lightning pace across national boundaries
creating
serious legal problems
ah for firms that to have to understand
oddly the difficulty of the difficult to
ah problem of having different the regulations
i'm different countries
in their deeper lot deeper problems here
associate with the food supply
i'm a include that
really are fractured legal and regulatory responsibility
i'll talk more about that in a few moments
private science
ah the fact that the majority of science that under lies
ah understanding be
the ia informal of facts
the health effects by the energy consumption
wired in order to produce a new food
anti
the energy required to work to do with a waste
the science is being conducted in the private sector it's often not available to the public sector
trade secrecy laws are you
is it
quite important in this case
and then it ain't often prevents you from understanding
in that detail
she really need to know in order to take control of your own diet
worker safety is another deeper problem that we don't pay much attention to
if you look at that we are they for the farm worker poisoning gator
becomes apparent that doubt
a workers are often
i'm not well protected
they are often
ah
not monitored
they often do not have thought
i assurance intend to
on health care
uh so that that
it's a neglected population
margaret workers said traditionally been exploited in almost every nation the world
current but even remark
cruel we think we have highly sophisticated lot
our workers really are not protected
i nearly the same as you or i would be
so that they're different standards for allow bore rest
for workers
again there are four
for a u. arise sake
you didn't in the marketplace
has different contamination limits
how
another deeper problem is the narrative it into the producers
you look at the scale of the advertising industry in their their methods of advertising is also be a great topic for paper
and where there were there tom and dominant a strategies
how do they make
claims of a product benefit
either that it is natural
ah that it is helpful
how far can they go or what was restrict what they can claim
what about their requirements to
i've disclose risks that they're known
to be associated with
whither foods
to sell its it's interesting
annette that you're getting food industry a vault
basically how growing from a strategy that
to uh-huh
claims that
a certain classic chemicals is not
present in the food supply
so synthetic
our organic pesticides are not allowed to be yours
not in a in organic foods
now that doesn't mean that those are producing
not organic foods have to label what
can it chemicals are in their food
about differently or strategies of my employed
ah in order to provide the consumer with knowledge that we really necessary
to understand
the reading
uh-huh
huh
public subsidies also ah are all a worthy
ah ah topic
for somebody interested in trying to to transform the
the at international food system
so if you
ah
look at the subsidies carefully and you can do this now because there is a group in washington called the informal working group
together terrific website
ah so you can go deep two of the website you can find your home state
in your counting your or your town
figure out which farmers are getting which subsidies
time which was say is that
to
industrialized deck commodities such as corn and wheat and cotton
but there are seen in the balkans subsidies in the nation
ah
as opposed to the organic farmers war or
farmers there beyond organic
who is lucy no subsidy
so that that no government funds could be used to two
invade tutoring transform
ah the structure of a band called termination
dad
this is not likely
in the near future
i'll lay indictments
how when guys play into the pattern of farming and arab culture that that we currently say
well no you witch
what i suggested earlier in the tacos attack i know is urban areas and suburban areas
we're all out into an develop lands
calmly
i will
uh-huh cause property diaries
the lands that are nearby
ah to increase
of the commercial thy you there there're a residential value for their best to value
on may shoot up
glee as a
as a city expands
uh so that dead the value of the uncle land
from a
in terms of its productivity for
different crops often king compete with this rising that
ah property value
i said that that the farmer sells out
also the
to way and
flat generally
i hate it also is
use a
i'm not force did
and what this means is that that it's really easy develop
so you can imagine the at a prom of developing that
for city area
ah it's much more expensive for landed on
so you find a the rate of transformation of farm land
ah from
from a
especially in that
roll part two the u. s.
that to
or in the target zone for urban expansion
i had these lands are are being
i shifted into into residential and commercial use of inward rapid rate
so come
ah
the fundamental problem that i think we face right now is is one of intelligence
i don't mean to imply that that it's absence of capacity
to understand these things
it's an absence of producing the knowledge and making it publicly exceptional to consumers
in a way that there really couldn't power you too
you out reaction the marketplace
in a way that was send messages back to corporations
a messages that i think that really
are often much more powerful
and that often
more listens to
ah then messages sent by regulators
i'm
and that like you think cap
ah
about corn and in ethel for just a moment
and gather the increasing subsidy for
the production of death and all
ah that diet
a no blocks jeannie fuels
i'm in that is
he's a choir by a at a different levels of government including the informal protection agency
come
as a way of improving your quality
hi
to know what is increasingly apparent
is that tat
of the f. and all
the subsidy is caused
a corn prices
ah tune rise quite dramatically
ah but does
worthy of farmers are are putting these ethel production plants
on their property
and there are not shining born into the food supply
ah
now haven't there also was in hop on over abundance of enthusiasm among the farmers to
produce the f. at all
this so
the ethel market to
started the collapse
and this is yes
farmers a throughout the united states
now about to one area and to the eerie of
go application
critically pesticides
this is an interesting year a unattended
demands itchy think about
a real variety of laws
ah buff
federal food drug and cosmetic act
here
federal insect decide plunge a sign reading the sacked
on the food quality protection act
these are the dominant statutes in the ad states that apply to
sighed the
ah control
well but other laws as well
are necessary to understand
and have some
the some control over
ah pesticides including the safe drinking water act
on other words the
one would need to worry about that the application of
billions of pounds of pesticides in united states every year
ah because pesticides often don't just go away
they they often will move down through soil son into ground water sup
flies
and so while we talk a bit till later in the
in that the week
about that that the problem managing not drinking water quality
by the way the government to
i his food intake surveys
concludes that
number one food that everybody sonny that states
i his water
water is classified as a food under the food drug and cosmetic act
ah huh so they
a worrying about the water contamination is really important issue
and understanding
of the way that to chemical release into the atmosphere is well isn't too
ah on a plant son into a
ah the landscape
on that
family drinking water
even if it goes through a filth ration plant
ah but to
and is a case for money or butter
resource conservation recovery act
either we talked a bit about last week in super fund
most of the sites have pesticides within them
and they are
classified as
has his sights in part because of pesticides that are there
two sides were in the
our wreck or sites in the surplus sights on be a case
ah
anomaly at chemicals or to our persistent were replied
thirties forties and fifties
hello
toxic sessions control act
ah does deal with pesticides
the hazardous material
his british neck does as well
national normal policy acted that we talked about last week
endangered species act
you have a endangered species
that to
and it's habit has been defined
it said normally illegal to apply pesticides
i in that him that habitat
all the wilderness act would prevent pesticides from being applied
a within it's boundaries
and the manufacture pesticides often
look
produces a airborne resumes
ah that are regulated under the clean air act
ah and also the release
a via pipes
from those plants
papa
is regulating the clean water act
ah but
as well
ah them
can that imagine the problem of
brain
chemicals
year after year a landscape
ah and then now you have our wayne storms coming in the spring
he did good example of that actors lunches and riverside
korea merging or besides so they plant the corn before the corn strauss
three the landscape with the actress scene
often in the spray
so i'm always in the spring actually
early in the midwest
hi after the spring rains come
can measures that spikes in that cruising in the mississippi river
and most mid western rivers
these rivers and the midwest provide water supplies for tens of millions of people
ah in the folks ration of the plants will not take it out
so both the clean water act was safe for drinking water act command
why in that case
the occupation safety and health
act
also is designed to protect
joe worker safety
ah but as i said earlier
but often set standards that are far above standards are
our road
set for
on a non worker environments
so it's a very complicated body of law
so for this reason pesticides becomes a good
good window to to understand law
ah
one way to think about this is that
it's driven by
things really
one is that
sides are
they're not to they're not like us into some new chemical was somebody designs
i know for a
to be added to the plastic to make it stronger
that wasn't designed
tuzla
kill a different species
designed to that
provide some function alley
ah but pesticides group of chemicals
how were specifically designed to
injured
your plan
ah hah an insect
some other species
fact some of the nerve gas is that were designed to a during war war to an end to
ah in the nineteen twenties by great britain and in that germany
i'm not to germany
they were designed specifically to arm ailments
and many of these nerve gas is it then that deluded down
a friend cultural purposes
so that all species of them targets
ah for the development to this class of last night
to number wondered intensely talk to sentences
a number two to get there a fact
gotta be released to the environment
quantities
so you release a chemical leave armand
i e.
in the atomic weapons testing
st
tells us you better understand sorry about work out
and that pesticide history is ripley with
examples where
a dead too little attention
now i want a lot step back
and that take you
to the earlier part
of the century
i want to think about that
a very serious problem
all at that point time than in the prom that persistent and that's malaria
malaria is a
an illness that's transmitted by parasite
hi
to
via an awful lee's mosquito end up all of it's
all of it's a very ants
i have
had the capacity
to
parasite op
from the blood
all the infected the animal or infected human
so
that if you had malaria
in an insect humiliated that new
ah
enough lease mosquito would first spit a little bit of money anti quite north
boss gets into your
in here a body
two i help you believe little bit
ah i met with sack
your blood
by into it's still the cavity
i in with that blood they would
colin
malaria parasite suitor your body
perhaps app i do next
to my didn't have malaria
that mosquito flew over and when that meek
i thought they would like me
and that when it would mean circuits
clint ike wagon
god it's saliva in meek
they would transmit parasites into my body that's the way that this
illnesses transmitted from person to person
a
parasite that
ah has the capacity to live for nine to levin days inside the body rooms
he illicit other than interesting
i teach you that that dad himself why this virus last from ten to twenty five days
and that thank god the aids virus
alas only want a today's
so that the de out want yeah video of different viruses are back
syria or
parasites
i inside defendant insects
a fax to look the rita transmission
i wanted to out also understand that the scale of this problem a world
today there are about to between
three hundred and five hundred million people
ah better quickly disabled by malaria meaning that they want their walking around with this parasite their bodies
ah the satin them of energy that is giving them curry addict
the wrist
ah that that makes them more susceptible other kinds of illnesses
ah and forty percent the world's population live in areas that that are at rest
meaning that the mosquitoes in that area
capable of transmitting the parasite
and you got a large population percentage that to
ah also was curing the the parasite their bodies
the end the core the prom for malaria in the world this is really got in tropical regions in and duh
jillian africa
where ninety percent of the incidents immortality
i exist
and that the vs in the right now by the world health organization is the rock we want to warn app million people die every year from malaria
on and the estimate
over the twentieth century is about a hundred million people
aw have died from the stillness
king of mould many people i have not understood the scale of this problem
so that it
it's also clear that if you are read much military history
that to malaria was a very serious problem in him
all wars
i so that if you go back to a time of up
ah hah napoleon
our hugh a look at the
ia ah history will really want
well we're too as
this us sor other countries moved into proper parts the world
bob more casualties calmly occurred more lost days
ah among the ammonia
she eyes
kurt
adieu to malaria it did to the direct effects of cash
there are also susceptible populations kids in intimate carriers that
ah although an epidemic so all age groups are affected
a refugees in margaret populations in those living in tents searches by those are
are a fighting in that
armed conflict
hi it's all related to heightened exposure being
it out in environment where
tonight you're you're expose yourself being bitten by infected
i insects
so you could also madge in the dead those that that to work in
in not mine sor those that are working for stream tropical parts the world or
or agricultural workers
they are also more rest
he was bennett
time out to outdoors and prophets
i indian in demi curious
are more risk
as are those with reduced immunity
who as reduced immunity
pregnant women
pregnant women are extremely susceptible to a very serious illness from from pregnancy and and and also miscarriage is
a
also that the very young young child and
are those that all already have their new system compromised
for in parts of of ahh
to the poorest parts the world
are you often have the
ground
hi incidents of
ah
she respiratory infections are dire real diseases
the reduces that
strength in immunity
and makes one more susceptible to two of the selves
oh what a way so controlling malaria
besides
and then there's an example of worker
in nineteen thirty nine in outbreak to him in the tall brazil
when that
a at a mosquito actually hitch bikes
ah from africa on a male boat
ah
an awful used the n. b. a. mosquito rod not
not that
indigenous to two
to brazil
so they they finally figured out that hitch hiking on this mill freighter
ah was able to
two out of our or a number of them did
and they were able to establish a app
for a large and robust population that occurred during a rainy season when
ah they had exactly the right
who'll walk on water steaming them
on the area said
so mosquitoes have actually reduced thing that they prefer
ah streams or rivers are moving really quickly as habitat
others like every still water
others like shallow water
uh so that that there are hundreds and hundreds a different species of mosquitoes capable
about transmitting
these these illnesses touches muller a. or dainty fever or yellow fever
thus if understanding the apology
here is really important
ah
one way of dealing with
of the problem and not understanding the college ee
basically to
please spray broader easily escape with with pesticides which is what they did this case
ah
but when the u. s. troops invaded
ah
islands in the pacific in the media war against the japan
high in the mid nineteen forties
the incense
among the u. s. g. i.'s was often
thousand per thousand three years it was reported
meaning that everybody on the island had on average
ah malaria at least
and the rates here
cause and have to move troops now in the island much more rapidly than they normally would have
huh
the
developer of the chlorine industry
hi is a very important part of the story because
chlorine physical key component
many pesticides were developed in the nineteen forties
ah including d. t.
according to hacker car buns
ah include
ah all done deal done kept a cork floor again
goals
curiously the became the target of a normal protection agency
as soon as it was formed in the nineteen seventy
and why is that
well because
all the properties that need strong chin ninety
ah dangers compound
persisted
bought it
moved widely through the informant
he would come to contaminated richly every compartment
ah and it would build up and food chain spring fu change as well as
this huh are a nico systems
ah and actress shirley to systems
they would get in people's bodies
there would be transmitted to
by breast milk across generations
so early
the air
a search was on
during this explosion in the chemical industry in the nineteen forties
for variety new chemicals would replace the older
maddox
paris green
in the previous shot
here
this gel menace mixing paris greenwich is his arsenic
he's mixing it by hand is a place that is throwing out across us
mom
so that the the heavy metals used earlier in the century were placed by the corny tiger occurrence
up and
ah
gradually they figured out that ted d. t. in particular was exceptionally effective at controlling the paris of the yep
insects are we would transmit the parasite
ah that that that is malaria
causes malaria
ah
so this was first tried
i as refugees moved through europe during world war two
and here's an example of taking out basically a very about a bicycle pump
posing
and of that
the drill that was followed was
ah there was one shot down the back of the neck
there was one shot shutdown of the
the we stand and then up to two of the lower part of the shirt
come back
ah and then couples with him right
so that tens of thousands of people were lined up in rome
walking through the stations
as people at work were sanitation workers and
how would basically a nice thompson spray people
this attempts a brought the titus epidemic
a
this transmitted bite by please
to up close
truly rapidly within a matter of a couple weeks
one was anticipated to
to a gone for four months if not years
another example of child at the time being spray
so gradually headed they recognize the d. t. would kill sully different species
ah but it was sprayed across marsh grandson and landscapes
and they realized that the in the world were too that they should also lisa friend cultural purposes
so by nineteen fifty
a d. t. was being marketing
as a eh
give way to control lot pass that would threaten
to bought every crop you could imagine
more than three hundred different crops
ah critical components of u. s. agriculture
all were recommended be to be treated by by the single camel
so the eighties good for me
others will jingle it when along with us that the kids would say
there was no understanding of of itself by looking malaysian capacity
by even though they understood that they are and the spray it wants in an area
ah i whereas other compounds they would have to come come back and keep on spraying
so uh
our tell that story in just a moment
here's another example of jones beach in new york
i wear that the county ia was public health department
driving down the beach
and that
the sign is on the silas truck to this truck he can't read ensure that
telling
says that petey
par for a sec decide
harmless to humans
the burr though understanding of
they were doing
kids we're running down that people eating their hamburgers
todd trucks would come by kids of the city a picnic tables
cable all of food and and other kids include would be sprayed
very little understanding of
the basic apology of this compound
i sell it persists in the soil
it was later discovered ten to thirty five years
and in the atmosphere
three years
susan aside
ah they decided the richest
the year just by chance be said well you know this is a ridiculous thing to do
ah but to thirty meters off the ocean
on a freighter
wait between stephens is going tokyo
ah they took
your measurements and found that the d. t. was present in the year
and a little the pacific ocean
that there was a latitude no great
great
so this you probes picnic waiter
a higher concentration of d. t.
on the if you move away
no i was sad
was because of the ia increased number of passage you get closer to the queer in tropical ports the world
all led those nations to spring worthy t. t.
forbes
but also for crop protection purpose
it's also found in human tissues
ah and it probably is still detected when you're tissue
in fact it was looking at the food and drug administration sell records
on pesticide resumes in the foods
why
striking in the duh
i even today
the teas
is one of the most attractive chemicals in the u. s. food supply particularly in milk products
i had very very low levels
but it's a good indicator of the the long term persistence of this compound
and why we need to pay attention to that
also not like strong chimp
today in breast milk
meaning that to if if you were breast fed
i your mom and probably had a higher concentration
hi
and in that
i you do but to any body greenwich you guys coming from
probably yet just as stores from year
your mom because his compound finds the body fat it's little fill it
as opposed to hide roof the like
and then
and duh
that's the yep
the way that the you'd be exposed to grandmother probably had residue is far higher than that in your mother
koreans generation will
ah the fact is is quite curious
in nineteen seventy one
ah the effort to regulated was
was really pioneer by vermont
ah vermont passed a lot
ah bathing beauty to use in the state
and they had formerly been spray it on their forced to control for gypsy moths
i have that i was followed
in that wisconsin
in nineteen seventy by oblivion
in new york in nineteen seventy one
ah by a ban
finally
i actually owe the british also left
i decided that the
ah
it was not a problem that debt
the b.
for for agriculture in the control public health whistled horton
can you be yours
where's the soviets found that
i it was worthy of a bear
came out so strongly
not in favor of a bear
finally in nineteen seventy two remember e. p. a. was created in nineteen sixty nine
i'm actually
came into being in nineteen seventy
the nineteen seventy two
ah way marcos house who's the former
administrator of the rhyme updated
shane c.
decided they should move ahead
cause of the facts on wildlife
but also the leah
humans
five he fell
the city that significant enough
to justified
for duration
and i know you can't read this but huh
ah there's an interesting
phrase cynicism leah
in york times
ah
to
to december as the thirty first nineteen seventy two
i mean tiny explain growers and cotton peanuts soy beans
other three crops account for almost a total domestic use and t. t.
all will get instructions in the handling of a substitute pesticide
or a fire
the substitute is
i can't really recall
is the non toxic
ah but i like the teeth
i do great
god quickly
so they're trading off
persistent chemical
ah for the one that degrees quite quickly
not really understanding what the long term of fact might be
huh
curiously cobb
but even manufacture companies that manufacture d. d. t.
todd said
themselves
what we know sir way that we could to modify the chemical structure of the compound
ah and stuff sell something that would be a minor burner
i they produced a compound is known as dyke a fall
ah that was
only a little bit different
and that i'll loan behold
all in all parts the country
out where dyke a fall was sprayed
found similar facts are wildlife
plea among a large rafters
a cell in the in the southwest we're going in the south i were cotton is grown
founded being be found dyke a fall building up just a way petey had
ah so it was little fill it
by cable news
and then that
basically
ah
again equally worry simply rumble protections
it's a band petey in eighty two and seventy two
oddly got around to recognizing that to
ah
natalie was dyke a fall
i haven't seen the facts
it also was contaminated by dainty a level about fifteen percent
and that they needed to get that that chemical out of foods
flies as a pen and out of the yep
ah and farm as well
so it took until nineteen eighty six for them to actually
move ahead with a regulation
and then to work its way out of production took until the early nineteen nineties
so
this is the van that was in the ban
but that bandit took effect in seventy two it really was not effective until
on the early nineteen nineties
now if you then jump ahead fast court's nineteen ninety nine
why you see that e. p. a. is getting around to studying
on that pulp verify on
the recommended substitute but we marcos house in nineteen seventy two
i he decided pablo for nineteen ninety nine
he decided this chemical
as more dangerous than we thought
plans responsible for more farm worker destined poisoning than any other chemical in history
not only is it to
far more truly toxic than t. t.
but
come
to
also persisted longer than they believed
so i
one of the hat concerns we have today is
i know where we going to do with
to
persistence of malaria
ah but also it's likely migration
in two parts of the world to
where it heated been well controlled
if you look it doubt where malaria
i exist now
see it that that
i'm larry is a problem for drama when the tropical
ford's the world also the poorest parts of the world
ah and you'll see that to
to range of malaria
of the different a species mosquitoes a carrier
it is widening
widening right now in response to
fewer changing climb out a condition
so the habitat is becoming more favorable for disease transmission
now the world health organization a recognize this and they called together group of people but to
burton pesticides and i worked on pesticides for media
ah fifteen years
and work with a group about tess seven other people
awesome from african nations
to tread understand how to manage malaria critically in africa
debbie way cho had gone along with the bands of e. p. a. in most other high income nations in the world
and had faced about it did not recommend the use of d. d. t.
in any part of the world
as of the mid nineteen seventies
they want to reconsider this because it was so expensive that was so
it was self active
hot in part because it was so persisted
they realize that it was sprayed both indoors and outdoors
cause
the insects to a ball resistant strains
on that would be harder and harder for them to manage
hi
fact many mosquitoes have developed a resistance to two
i d. t.
so that they spray it on a wall inside a house
ah the
i'm not please the skilled when i'm a wall
could sense it through its feet
and they would take off
that that's a solace a new behave or responsive
to prevented it from a absorbing a lethal dose
so i'm gradually have the world health organization the became me
turned about
increasing not incidents of malaria
go in africa
ah and the convened this group to to try to figure out what about it made sense
ah too
to get behind god d. t. intention to
i use it again
and that the next most effective pesticide
cost four times the level
of duty
ah so this is a problem
and that the the aid agencies were not willing to pay this increased expense
so that
that
our debbie wait show
bob finely in two thousand six
i gave
the t. a clean bill of health
so to speak
but even though this group of experts a bid to hide convened in in two thousand four
a
found it
well known using the teas ruin a good idea
should you celeste
call one that is less persistent
odd that would be equally effective
but even though it cost more so it's a matter of finding the money
in order to pay for
that would protect human health
ah come in that
a informal quality
the same time it would deal with a malaria problem
so hot i'm a time when the stop there
that will come back on thursday and take a closer look at the variety of laws
that applied to
the nation
