mcdb global problems of population growth lecture notes 
we are now at the point in the class where we have come forward in time to whats usually called the population explosion 
i want to tell you about my first introduction to this phenomenon 
when i was just a little bit older than you are now i went walking around asia 
hong kong 
in hong kong in those days many of the people lived on small boats sampans in the harbor i visited these and on each one there seemed to be a little girl about maybe years old who seemed to be doing all the work they were never introduced to me and they clearly werent treated as members of the family i was told that they were servants 
asked around and eventually found out that these were excess girl children who were sold to be servants to other poor families people were embarrassed about it and i couldnt get much information 
later i visited the big british hospital queen elizabeth hospital and was taken to several wards full of girls or or younger they were infected with tuberculosis we think of tb as a lung disease but it can also get into the bones in these girls the tb had infect the bones and the bacteria had eaten its way through the bones and the pus was oozing out through holes in the skin 
pbs mrs roosevelt wife of the president died of bone marrow tb 
i found out that these were the same little girls that i had seen on the sampans they were sold as servants when they were little girls and almost all eventually came down with tb these little girls were sold by poor families to be servants to other poor families slaves would be a better word they lived hard and neglected lives and when they started to be sickly they would be taken to the health authorities who would give them powdered milk and other food supplements this food would be taken home and fed to the boy children the girls would get sicker next time the health authorities would give them medicines these would be taken to the market to be sold and the money was used to buy rice for the boy children eventually when the pus started oozing through the skin they would be dumped at the big hospital but they were too far gone and would die in a few weeks 
well what i saw and what i was wrestling with then soon came to be included under the term the population explosion that nexus of deep poverty dense population and rapid population growth that had most of the worlds people in its grip 
i have never seen anything in print about this major public health calamity 
i have never seen any statistics on how many girls died of tb in those years 
when i prepare for this course i want to be sure that everything i say has a factual basis this is a story that i cant back up after a while i began to get worried am i remembering correctly am i exaggerating or embellishing the story is it a slur on the chinese people did i just see some exception and mistake the exception for the general rule 
by i had just about decided not to tell the story any more to delete it from the class 
a few days after i told this story in i gave a make up midterm to a few students after the exam i started chatting with one student the student was shy and i think if she hadnt had to take the make up i would never have heard what she told me 
she told me her mother had been one of those girls orianna dutkas mother was one of these girls in she was in the same hospital i described with tb she was only but she was not abandoned by her parents her parents came to visit her in the hospital as a child she remembers wondering why none of the other parents came to visit their children and the death rate was horrific probably because she had parents to go back to a british dr worked very hard to save her the tb had gotten into her long bones and she now is missing a hip and some other parts of her leg but she survived came to america is a prof of english literature and her daughter went to yale 
global population 
graph of long term growth fig 
why is the word explosion used 
in exponential growth the rate of growth or or some other year stays constant in global population growth the percentage kept increasing from to to then and eventually yr the number of people added each year grows because 
each year the growth rate was on a higher base 
the percent of growth was itself increasing 
until very recently world population growth was not exponential but was hyperexponential 
anyone who argues that we shouldnt be worried about the population explosion because weve coped with growth in the past has never seen this graph 
this sharp rise is absolutely unprecedented in human history 
we are in utterly unknown territory 
the worlds population just keeps on increasing 
we are now over billion 
it will almost certainly get to bill by to bill in 
the of people added each year also increased but has now slowed a bit off its peak 
ann increment slide 
now if someone wants to be more optimistic they can present this data as a age percentage slide 
but it is only declining because the base is getting larger 
the increase in numbers has barely budged the key number to remember is 
million slide 
the explosion is going to continue because 
in d world of population is years old prb world pop data sheet 
they will soon enter their reproductive years 
the largest group ever is about to enter adulthood 
billion people are between and yrs old 
of them live in less developed countries pop today 
another billion and a half are right behind them 
thats billion young people entering their reproductive years in this generation 
thats equal to the entire world population in 
under optimistic assumptions it is almost inevitable that population will rise above its current level by and continue growing after that repeat of slide 
un report reported on pbs oh us census bureau proj to 
repeat anyone who says that look weve coped w population growth in the past theres no need to worry about the future repeat of slide 
is guilty of gross misunderstanding of the problem 
we have no way to predict the results of this type of population growth 
in terms of the strain on human institutions 
and the stress on the earths environment 
i am not predicting disaster or anything else i left my crystal ball at home 
the point is 
when the population grows like this were just gambling wildly with the future 
the population problem is really two rather different problems 
the first is over consumption by large numbers of rich people 
the second is under consumption by vastly larger numbers of poor people 
over consumption leads to global warming depletion of the worlds resources pollution destruction of habitat etc etc etc 
i call these things environmental misery 
under consumption is poverty and all the attendant evils that poor people suffer 
i call these things human misery 
for any individual usually one or the other of these problems grabs us by the heart strings 
we either worry about population because its bad for trees 
or we worry about population because its bad for people 
its amazing how rarely an individual worries about both 
this course is set up to worry about both 
so many people are now green and there is so much information about the environment available that environmental misery gets a smaller portion of the course 
nevertheless we will consider environmental misery later in the term 
us population 
us pop crossed million in the year http www census gov main www popclock html 
us pop growth to nyt slide 
us pop grows by million yr or yr rw calc from world pop data sheet 
natural increase immigration pop bull rw calc from world pop data sheet 
of immigration legal illegal 
the importance of our population growth is that the average american 
or equally someone in another rich country 
consumes about x what someone in a poor country consumes 
so the us population growth of million yr translates to an increase in consumption approx equal to that of million or so poor people 
that is a humongous factor when considered globally 
so we are a tremendous drain on the earths resources 
even worse as producers of waste and pollution 
its not getting better us pop growth to nyt 
us census bureau used to say that 
us population will stabilize meg by 
but we passed million years before their projection 
now they say that our pop will double in the next century with no sign of stabilization yale daily news from ap us pop growth 
the projection for is now million http www census gov population projections nation npaltsrs txt 
the politicized argument over whether the population problem is 
primarily rich people consuming too much or 
poor people reproducing too much has little value 
the million added americans each year a good fraction of them immigrants from poor countries consume an increment roughly equal to that of the or so million added people in developing countries 
the argument also has the western perspective that we are rich and will remain so while poor countries will remain poor not so 
many countries are developing fast and catching up to our levels of consumption 
this is truly a global problem not one of haves vs have nots 
the other side of the coin is poverty 
of this growth will occur in the poorest countries state of world pop 
where people already suffer from brutal poverty starvation and civil strife 
virtually all of the growth will be in the cities of these poor countries 
to cope with urban growth the poor countries will have to build the equivalent of a city of more than million people each week for the next years j cohen sci am p 
most people in the us have no idea what poverty means when discussed on a global scale

look at the blue line in more than of the worlds people lived on or less a day 
another or so lived between and green line 
so all together of the worlds people lived on a day or less 
billion people in the world live in less than a day billion people consume less than a day in prices world bank from data you can see that things have gotten better over time 
by only of the worlds people live in day or less green line 
i shudder to think what the numbers look like now after the recent rise in 
food and fuel process and the collapse of the world economy

almost all of this progress was in china 
in china was poorer than the rest of the developing world 
by it was richer 
you can see that the dashed lines w o china are much flatter 
little progress has been made 
later in the term well discuss the relationship between chinas progress and its population policies 
but now the news is full of all the factory closing in china and people returning to their villages nyt had a story on sunday there are million migrant laborers last year factories in and around guangzhou canton closed in just the past few months million have lost their jobs these people have to go back to their villages and try to survive on their land but in the village that the times covered the average farm size was of an acre most of bethany just nw of new haven where i used to live is zoned for acres thats just for a single family house the amount of land that chinese peasant families are expecting to live off 
each country sets its own official definition of poverty

http siteresources worldbank org dec resources poverty brief in english pdf in discussing poverty in middle income countries and regions such as latin america and eastern europe higher lines are called for a day is more appropriate for these regions

the of people on earth in poverty is going down 
but there are so many more people on earth that the absolute number of poor people may be going up 
the world bank defines poverty as less than day as an example it calculates that the in poverty fell from in to in 
but it also calculates that the of people living in poverty increased by more than million from to nyrevbooks

wages in mexico in the assembly plants near the us border are too high there so of the jobs have already gone to china 
youve heard about the economic miracle in asia the miracle is when peasant who lives on day gets a job in the modern sector actually a sweatshop factory paying enough so that he and his family can live on day 
so abject poverty is less than day 
and the miracle starts at day 
this nexus of poverty and overpopulation is found everywhere on earth 
places at the end of the earth that you never heard of are exploding 
the ends of the earth are in the desert in the deep jungle and on top of the highest mountains

let us try to imagine a scenario in which world fertility comes down to replacement level and world population eventually stabilizes 
fertility doesnt come down w o some improvement in standard of living 
as youve seen a lot of the earths people live on less than day 
lets take a wildly optimistic assumption that at a day they will reduce their fertility thats a doubling of their standard of living a true miracle 
we know that when the global economy improves rich people improve faster than poor people so to double the income of the poorest half of humanity will require than the average income for everyone will have to more than double 
so the average standard of living on earth has to at least double as a precondition for a soft landing of the population problem 
now weve also seen that world population will increase by 
so thats x as many people and at least x the average income 
thus the global economy will have to at least triple before the population stabilizes 
most people think that the earth is at a tipping point for its environment already 
can the earth cope with at least a tripling of the worlds economy 
that means taking out x the resources from the earth that we are taking now putting out x as much co producing x as much pollution finding living space in the habitat for more people 
advances in technology will reduce those drains 
but by how much 
can the earth sustain a tripling or quadrupling of the strain on it we dont have the foggiest idea 
its just a huge gamble with the future of the planet
