destruction of mycenaean palace sites loss of writing 
dark age in greece time of migrations throughout greece and eastward across the 
aegean athens escapes dorian invasion migration kingship survives the collapse of mycenaean civilization but the king is far less powerful than the wanax of the palace period numerous petty kings basileis are the heads of various oikoi and prominent leaders claiming descent from gods or heroes these figures attend the kings council and later form the class of nobles existence of assemblies of the people i e the fighting men laws in this period are the ancestral customs rules and judgments which have evolved from generation to generation to regulate society and to make civilized life possible in homer they are called themistes or dikai contrast the uncivilized cyclopes thucydides describes the decentralization that existed in attica during the dark age under cecrops and the first kings down to the reign of theseus attica had always consisted of a number of independent cities each with its own town hall and magistrates except in times of danger the king of athens was not consulted in ordinary seasons they carried on their government and settled their affairs without his interference sometimes they even waged war against him as in the case of the eleusinians with eumolpus against erechtheus athens like other greek states in the dark age was ruled by a hereditary king who with the addition of nobles from other settlements gradually lost power and became a 
primus inter pares 
the nobles seriously curtail the powers of the kingship and place two magistrates beside 
the king the archon ruler and the polemarch leader in war who take over the most important functions of the government eventually the kingship ceases to be a lifelong hereditary office and becomes an annual magistracy instead early aristocracies were controlled by an exclusive council and a small number of magistrates who succeeded the kings in athens the areopagus council develops from an old council of elders which had advised the king it becomes an important and dominant body in the aristocratic state

annual archonship established possible time when kingship becomes an annual magistracy 
instead of a hereditary lifelong office year named after eponymous archon the archon chief executive of state presided over the council when it sat in a legislative or deliberative capacity and over meetings of the assembly he also had jurisdiction in litigation concerning the family the polemarch leader in war in addition to his military duties had jurisdiction in cases affecting resident aliens in attica and the basileus king retained only his supervision over the religious practices of the state i e the ancestral rites and sacrifices he also presided over the council when it sat as a judicial body to try cases involving religion

solons constitution such as the council of four hundred peisistratus established a system of thirty local or circuit judges to decide minor disputes in rural areas of attica they handled disputes against a tribe other than their own these magistrates were abolished after the expulsion of hippias 
cleisthenes establishes the framework for athenian democracy he substitutes tribes 
based on demes for the four traditional ionian tribes based on phratries and gene as the fundamental units of government but retains the aristocratic and plutocratic character of the state essentially discards the four old ionian tribes as a political factor tribes instituted to reduce factional struggles between powerful families four census classes serve as criteria for assignment of privileges and duties leadership of men connected with powerful and wealthy families higher magistrates chosen only from the upper classes the pentakosiomedimnoi and the hippeis a boy on becoming years of age was enrolled in the deme of his father this enrollment automatically assigned him to the tribe of that deme and indicated citizen status sons of athenian parents not legally married were also enrolled in demes and recognized as citizens but as illegitimate children nothoi they were barred from membership in a phratry limiting their rights of inheritance and prevented them from holding the archonship and priesthoods minimum age for eligibility for the archonship years old after a term of one year archons automatically become members of the areopagus council no pay for government service kept the poor from significant participation in political life of athens areopagus retains considerable influence as a highly conservative body board of generals established people elect generals on a tribal basis one from each of the new tribes officers known as taxiarchs elected by the assembly to command the tribal regiments chief organs of government are the archons generals and various boards of magistrates assembly ecclesia of all citizens including the landless

what changes took place in the athenian economy during the seventh century to what extent are the economic social and political pressures in athens similar to or different from those in states that experienced tyrannies in the seventh century is athens politically progressive or backward in the seventh century 
what was the system of government in athens like before solon how stable was it what do cylons conspiracy and dracos code indicate about athenian politics in the generation before solon was dracos code a progressive or a regressive measure 
to what extent does the evidence of solons career shed light upon the economic problems of his day who were the hektemoroi did they differ from those being enslaved for debts were economic conditions getting worse or did solons reforms result from the growing assertiveness of newly prosperous classes demanding yet faster change was the situation that led to his reforms merely the attempt of aristocrats to manipulate grievances long extant in attica so as to pave their way to a tyranny by betraying the class interests of other groups 
what was solons social economic and political background was he a revolutionary or a reformer a radical a moderate or a conservative was solon a tyrant who benefited the most from his reforms what did he do for the lower classes for the middle classes for the wealthy was athens under solon a democracy or was it an oligarchy 
did solon found a council of did he reform the coinage system what role did the ekklesia have in his constitution

what does this list suggest about the attitude of some leading athenian families toward the tyranny does this list suggest that the position of hippias was strong or weak after his fathers death what impact did the assassination plot have on the downfall of hippias what other factors were at work why was hippias less successful than his father in maintaining power why he was unable to regain power as his father had done 
consider cleisthenes family and background what political stance was he likely to have held what position had the alcmaeonids taken toward cylons attempt at tyranny how did they benefit from solons archonship what was their position during the period of solons self imposed exile was cleisthenes hostile to the tyranny if yes why was he 
what were the elements of cleisthenes reforms do they include the development of ostracism or the enfranchisement of a large number of people who were formerly not citizens what is the importance of new social groupings 
what was the purpose of cleisthenes reforms were they intended to break the aristocratic monopoly of government were they intended to secure the position of the clan of cleisthenes in attica what was the purpose of the trittyes 
was cleisthenes a democrat by conviction an aristocrat who betrayed his class and his own principles to gain power or an aristocrat who did not realize the implications of the reforms he initiated did cleisthenes intend the results of his reforms or is he an opportunist who let things get out of hand 
reconstruct the political scene in which groups supported isagoras was he a friend of the tyrants or was this just cleisthenic propaganda what type of government did isagoras envision why were harmodius and aristogiton gloried in the popular memory as the liberators of athens and cleisthenes ignored 
why did the spartans act in the peculiar manner they did what do the events suggest about cleomenes position in sparta and about spartas position within its system of alliances does sparta deserve its ancient reputation for having liberated greece from tyranny
