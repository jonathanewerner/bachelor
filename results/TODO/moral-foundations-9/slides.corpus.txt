the basic problem of classical political economy 
how is profit possible according to marx 
the transformation of money into capital has to be developed on the basis of the immanent laws of the exchange of commodities in such a way that the starting point is the exchange of equivalents the money owner who is as yet only the capitalist in larval form must buy his commodities at their value sell them at their value and yet at the end of the process withdraw more value from circulation than he threw into it at the beginning its emergence as a butterfly must and yet must not take place in the sphere of circulation these are the conditions of the problem 
part ii 
the labor theory of value exploitation and injustice 
freedom the absence of alienation 
t he division of labor offers us the first example as long as man remains in natural society that is as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest as long therefore as activity is not voluntarily not naturally divided mans own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him for as soon as the division of labor comes into being each man has a particular exclusive sphere of activity which is forced upon him and which he cannot escape he is a hunter a fisherman a shepherd or a critical critic and he must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood while in a communist society where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow to hunt in the morning fish in the afternoon rear cattle in the evening and criticize after dinner just as i have a mind without ever becoming hunter fisherman shepherd or criticthe german ideology 
the labor theory of value 
the exchange value of any commodity is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time snlt for its production snlt is defined as the labor time required to produce any use value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of the labor prevalent in the society 
the labor theory of surplus value 
living human labor power is the only source of new exchange value labor power is a commodity like any other its exchange value is determined by the snlt needed to produce it labor power has one unique property its consumption as a use value leads to the creation of fresh exchange constant and variable capital c c v

socialism a society based on genuine workmanship 
what we have to deal with here is a communist society not as it has developed on its own foundations but on the contrary just as it emerges from capitalist society which is thus in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges accordingly the individual producer receives back from society after the deductions have been made exactly what he gives to it he receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such and such an amount of labor after deducting his labor for the common funds and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost 
socialism a society based on genuine workmanship 
hence equal right here is still in principle bourgeois right although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case in spite of this advance this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation the right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an equal standard labor 
socialisms limitations 
but one man is superior to another physically or mentally and supplies more labor in the same time or can labor for a longer time and labor to serve as a measure must be defined by its duration or intensity otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement this equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor it recognizes no class differences because everyone is only a worker like everyone else but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment and thus productive capacity as a natural privilege it is therefore a right of inequality in its content like every right right by its very nature can consist only in the application of an equal standard but unequal individuals and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view are taken from one definite side only for instance in the present case are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them everything else being ignored further one worker is married another is not one has more children than another and so on and so forth thus with an equal performance of labor and hence an equal in the social consumption fund one will in fact receive more than another one will be richer than another and so on 
superabundance and communism 
these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby 
in a higher phase of communist society after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor has vanished after labor has become not only a means of life but lifes prime want after the productive forces have also increased with the all around development of the individual and all the springs of co operative wealth flow more abundantly only then then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners from each according to his ability to each according to his needs

moral assumptions behind workmanship 
or consider robert nozicks question 
why does mixing one s labor with something make one the owner of it perhaps because one owns ones labor and so one comes to own a previously unowned thing that becomes permeated with what one owns ownership seeps over into the rest but why isnt mixing what i own with what i dont own a way of losing what i own rather than a way of gaining what i dont if i own a can of tomato juice and spill it into the sea so that its molecules made radioactive so i can check this mingle evenly throughout the sea do i thereby come to own the sea or have i foolishly dissipated my tomato juice
