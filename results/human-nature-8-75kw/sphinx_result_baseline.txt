so why don't you talk about
he ain't today's lecture
ears
i still am became the philosophical tradition
that wilkes not act the way he's being weights
you mean inter connected nets
can provide
meaning and the possibility for flourishing
but what's looks rather a cactus
stuart
love
the logical detachment
ask away
dealing with a
the inevitable
shoots
all the late it's
barry it's
and
there is to take a nation of all the outlook that will be considering today
in the context
ah the western tradition
can be found in the writings
all the philosopher
here is all wonderful
imaginary portrayed on him
from seventeen fifth
lou
sid ng added table
thankfully with he's
paying
she used to walk
salt
his name
outs you know who found the reading guide
at that tedious
live it pat
the beginning ah
to millennium ago he made him laugh leaf rom
did he
to one thirty in the common ella he was only keenan
greek speaking
asia minor
and
was that second wife living again though the roman empire during that era
only portion on his wife has
slave
here's some decide as to whether
kill the age of
team
or until the age of twenty seven but in any case a significant portion of his life
what's that
beans
bravery
bottom actually gained freedom mats
o. point
either before or after gaining freedom
he started
bill works
and
philosophical outlook
all the tradition
known
ads
doses
and the works that were produced
aw and see if the happen have survived
aren't you
the first isn't the turf
for volume
collection
ah but he's discussions double range of topics
question seeing medicaid thinks the widow
i think about the way the world this question vindictive to mala cheek
how does that understand the world
and also questions in ethics
and king addition to back
i survived beats
to ordinary bulk
that we read for today
the little
forty five kappa graf
essay
known as
the handbook
which was
so there's that old
drooping recorded by one of the epic edi sis
students
preserved
you got wet
now i don't want that attitude is produced in the context of the handbook
was enormously influential for most of the two thousand years
back to highs
being part of the western tradition
you think killer this
let us
peace
that i used to show you a picture i act
easy drop
from
the library
ah
not not there
benjamin
adams
the second president of the units
who have this book
he he is
collecting
being
eighty's
seventeen fifty
hello
laughter
edition
wait till their eclipse
i do think
you to know historically about
the volume that were reading
first don't translation operate
one thing factor
don by
oh great
eighteenth century woman of letters
elizabeth carter
though the translation that we're reading he is
i'm more modern
version of that
so uh yeah this work every kid
don many all that
connects
ah
doses
so we've been introduced in this class of far
first to the writings
all played all
who he is a systematic philosopher he has views about everything
and if commitments are to a certain kind of
nationalist formal it's
i deal with lots of
and we've been introduced
to the works
aristotle
to rule one
bob please
right is
the
committee and ethics
oh i bonus
to tradition the time tradition in the rustic jillian tradition
ancient philosophical world produced
i know are all the others
to mac
how hoops that had views about
almost
any question you could acts
among those was the view known ads
so it says
so's oats hound
we've missed
you
underlying medic typical facts
about reality
don't move to
he itself
he is it but
organic
physical toe talents
bits and governed by what they call the locals
we're divine these things
there he is
on order
shoo
the world
that activists i believe on human beings
given that
he is tomb
call today
you look kind all
virtue on this don't picture
e. s.
act think nina a pool art
we've what resume tells you
nature good man
eat ghali not a long wait
the ace
grand scheme of things
i'm not trying
fight against
what he is
pre divine
for
you
so it's that surprising that
elements
all up bestow tradition
get that ah
being subsequent
do you think
traditions
in some ways the skeleton you
that the world is all well ordered and take
governor by divine reason
live act a hard
all
maybe
all
the religious traditions that are familiar to you today
the question then becomes what he is demanded of your perspective what should you do
give these two things are the case
i want us alex suggest is that you need to it's
that
he is the consequences
ah but power and goodness of the local us even though the week in which it is good for you maybe
on available to you
c.
i am back in order to do so you need to moderate or desirous
you need to avoid it back
in motion
and verified
come to act
in the accord with music
so the contemporary you said the terms
still one whom
that eighths
press offering in the face of paying
he not
on this
and all beast
i think going to recognize that
how can we
all of the philosophers that we reading
this is part of a systematic world view
the ag is not get a little bit here and a little bit there
and we don't worry about
yeah see if they haven't
idea about the nature
fundamental nature of reality
of you about how we know that
and then views about what we ought to do as a consequence
now i see this
in the handbook
he is concerned
only with a small portion all bestow with pitcher
he's concert
basically
we have a writing
the very first
self
manual
he's trying to tell you
mr warden days
as saying
all of
ancient
roman world in about
the year
what true joan if you would like
and here is what tells you you need to do
you need to marta how to wrists
on appropriately to experience
i doing three things
you need to alter your purse axes
of the world so that you come to what apprehended things in such a way
they don't
influence you
harmful week
we need to altered or desirous
with respect
to the world
hey unique
chance
clap sure you wore a white
in such a way
she's stay in august
drake and now
he needs instructor socially oceans
in ways that will help you
thing
commitment
i don't next strike a minute
how can you read
rumour the tax
how
i think it could ways all bloody each of this
it is
ah the bulk
into one of these categories
so for example when attic he does
how's that
that we need to alter our perception of the world
here is that we specific waves that he thinks we might
go about doing it
opponents
to this
instruction
the first is that we need tape
i really classified things
you two categories
things over which we have control
more about that in a moment
i think the omar which
don't have control
so we need to jacked our tax
china needs
down
we need also
anticipate
mom we're the world's
please i'm forwards
so we do not don't you know what is that one what is that tell us
but i'm look things that aren't up to us
we need says structure our expectations in such a weight
that we are emotionally prepared
for what will the flawless
and again
more about that in the couples
right
yet we need to recognize
in some ways this is a sob point of the first
the wall back
judgment
police
hey
we do turn the name
whether it be that he is the case
that experiences
a fax
so those are three things that at the key defense we need to
do with wrists
get out of examples of
ot
each of them in a moment
edition would lie to us
thing that we need to
he don't we need to carlton bank appropriate
drives
we need to get our desires and lined up with the world in such a way that we arts
operation
i know we need you this
he is by converting
and relation
queen desire
and the world
usually a
desirous
graf
a way things
aunt
what you wish they were
i desired for only yesterday
but they're not be
the snow day in three weeks
for my children
but the world refused
cooperate
on back
question
hey if that they just did my desires
the world
i desire that things go want exactly as well those
dec
then i would happy
content
make their presence
in my office
this i think that patents
hume
he in
strategy i think
do you this it's it's
to ordinary feeling capacity
to a silly things from one category
things
from
another
so now i showed you
the way since election task
anything we tag
i
a and a half
and of four and a sad end
and a half in which cardinal had to turn over it
growing whether it was true
that isn't a on one side
there's a seven on the other
doin' that
a half
was
part
but what is shirt you that it was structure only identical to another task
attack
of being shown for cards
which had beaches
alcoholic or non alcoholic drinks
and a after which cards you need
turnover
to verified it true that if somebody ease drinking a beer
then she is over twenty won
all three were able to i'm nervous then
the difficult problem
you like all the problem with respect to which you had
i see it is points i too was that we have
don't sack
for letting go
we have a skill sacked
for
don't like to call
we have a few seconds think
stop happens
any documented
and what he said yes we do when it cannot give an example of this
to learn not to us
certainly
the finger which we find
hard to let the walls
to the things which we find it easy
collect a lot
and there i cuts
like this capacity that we have
for metaphor it
understanding
certainly in this category at the kid's point that the dump
ah habitually beat yourself to
the indebted ability
all the loss
here's some bad news for all of you
you weren't
when to die
shall we take in half in the entire
course about this
about coming to terms
we had these inevitable fact about human existence
but i just said don't
why huh
i mean is on board
profoundly
in a way that the facts
see you
not just
the lab love
being able to utter the words
i will die some day
but the level of relief
habitually eating it
to you or relations to things
oh crime room
things that seemed incredible lead
important
loom
massa
don't they
i think he did it points out the importance
few points
you were
in ways that minute
can the norm is your culture
you what some real life in the two pointed yet
nay didi its social feedback
somehow creature actor capitals
describes the newport news
all the resisting social pressure
when people say i have no
you are seeking honoring gloria you must be a loser
actually defense
lap and face now
they're not what they say
about two
and at that point acts
here
they are almost fifth
teen packages that
bye
strategy
certainly
he give you a kind a trick
so that he wants you to call today
must be
kind of silent
pulse say stop and you just
calmly
it will respond
sell this
strategy
that he's presenting to ask
to remain parts
am i doing the neck
all black tourist to run for sums
samples
obvious
looking first acted as his tax
quoting a direct link
and then
jacqueline song contemporary and alarms
what is the deputy disease talking about
so we don't paragraph
ah that the pieces handbook
he is one of the most
they missed
all philosophical writing
in the western tradition of the last two thousand years to begin a sense olive
something interactive laugh
some things are not act
alas
aren't you tear up the cats
and our impulse is
our desires our versions
in short what every these are only doing
i'm not are not kept
blacks
betty is though that the coal
jobs no ark
it is
our reputation as our public office they is
whatever it is not our own doing
now this canada lining point out
a mistake you can make
the finn otto asa wright nature of
greta i'm hanged heard and i mean it's
needed where is the things that are not apt
watts
and that means blade
he angered and not parking
what do you think that things that are naturally in slate
better not up
see you
aren't you work only if you think think naturally in slate turf
three e.
with that things that are not your food are you
you will be
from what it
miserable
abstract
and walking round leaving the world for everything that
going wrong with
the mis think ah
do you think
that over which you have control
and that over which you lack
cool
needs to
what did he
upset
miserable
leading us
i cooked craft keeping these categories
plate
brings the greatest
cries
if you think that only one easy wars is worse
annette what is not your ponies not your own
i
no one will ever call worse you
no one will ever hindu you will blame no mind you will attack
hughes anyone
you do not us
single thing unwilling wit
because it oh things over which use
i happen to fall
what are the things over which
you actually don't have control
i never consequences no one can course you
because you're only concerned about the things that are opt
see you
no one can hear you
he caught nobody can get in the way at all the things that are
now
do you
who has experience with
a frannie
or relative
when acquaintance
who has taken part being
one that bald
the many
contemporary virtues
i picked yes
in the four modest out
progress
knows that at the heart above the contemporary it
well stacked
live
a version of all this epic
what
what to elite incurred more most likely
first
i rang the bell
and that is
mr renegade prayer
which you can find
decorated
humming birds
and
yeah fidel scott grant me the serenity to accept the things i can act
mules
courage to change the things that happen
and wisdom
you know the difference
if morning glorious archer style you can find it decorated it
dole
orange angel
or a young child
you can find it
on a bowl
poor most striking levy
you can find it
how can be
plan your part
for your style
or your side
still
do you marries
think he in yet
next leaks tomb the contemporary
mine
and speaks to it being a away
that when i did a global image
for serenity prayer
i've found
how does and thousands of images like this
he in any language you can
think of
so this i think that we need this
think wish
between things that we can change and things that we can act
and that i haven't heard of it
we're think habits and all the effort
is what's appropriate towards things that we can
he is a laugh and that ethics
he gets
hats
offered
to
the western tradition
second example let it keep us how class
about being what is
ah a motion awaken nation
the room
anticipating what we yell
prints
to you
in a particular set
so he sat
oh you are going to gold
boom

to me
i don't quite believe it
something which does not
herb
mine
feeling all
call
very funny at the tedious suggests
do you
you see to what guys
that what he is
thank you os
i'm not
things that happen
but not them
our judgments
about those things
i knew i hope when i showed you that image from the metropolitan museum
ah socrates yeah
upon drinking that hamlet
and to fooled you
that
ah yeah
not with nobility
recording it by a good to see a party to it
something true but with socrates
and
if
carpenter herbs
from nasa right
you such cases
one can third wound
all
perhaps don't
for people's thoughts
about how to deal with
human life
and it's a net abilities
so happy tedious search what think people are not things but they don't think about those things for example
yeah
in it's not the senate
my could be nothing dreadful
poor kid who are dreadful then socrates
the great wise one
what a hacked out to to be dreadful
what ask don't about jack
not decades
sal
what is a dreadful about dad
ease the judge made
about
gap
that beat eased
dreadful
nothing new
he is
harmful mean it's
it's ah to you leather united
harm
when you teach your children not to be ops
why
bill thought lists wants
ah there classmates
what you talk to them that he is
what a classmates
say about them
come
i laugh
it's emotionally disturbed me
if you don't
if you don't whacked it hurt you
speaking richie
i find morrison given to this
lawrence olivier
playing hamlet
even famous rosen trance and gilded buster
scene
ah
hamlet
check could actually are for you because i understand there is
hamlet
happening in one of the colleges
in a couple of weeks
sol candidate in conversation with these two and a fairies
and complaining about what our rotten place
denmark
yes
then
they disagree
they set up
then not dawson strike us
as still ban
and faintly hamlet
says
back
why then do you
for the jury's not think either buddha were bad but
teammates
so
when you walk round the world
i had shades
and sighs
miss it
cable is
rex handler
these walls are
white
the temperature is back in fact these art
world
but don't don't have bases
attached to them
not at the hatched
to an event
that haiti is good
the war bat
it is us a half a minute
ah be event
that gives it back
the lights
that's the third at the teaching
point
fourth point
i tedious
going for
out
that there are two liza all happening
science
one can on the one hand
half the world to conform to what you want
oh i think tank
you want
conform to the world
at the key gets papers
hey do not want hack bank
you as you want them to
what if i
maud ma'am happened
i need you
i
you were in life will go well
certainly get out
hundred percent yelling to see that you get what you want
i want
what you get
if you want what you get you will get
to want
still concert philosophy highness away it all
writings
i'm one of the ways of thinking about it the use this notion that they call direct
think about what i shopping list
so because i had fun part to make left over from mac
signed with the double a few weeks ago
thought i'd use it for my shopping list
so here i am on enlightened by at the keith and i right on my shopping list but i didn't
her eyes
broccoli and when you sit
and so i go to the store and above don't have my desire depend upon their be
apple
broccoli
and
limits
you say
enlightened by eighteen this
go through this store
look and see what's there
paul latter part think he can't make you a nest
apples
broccoli and lands
so our there's no difference between else
even though you worse
strategy
what's to shake your desire to fit the world
i'm not crack to eat
what's to try to shape the world
get my desire
but what happens to wes
when the store
ouch
broccoli
i have on my nest
how whose
want to lead
and lemons
dick do you know all
and sat back
frustration
you owe
i can track and fitted so i have to don't
you want
what
what
so how
it you show nest
and everything is
fine
the act the mood
i do your
is that if you shave your desirous to
the way things are packed
we are
you will never are
b.
frustrated
fourth suggestion
where
one of you must be keeping count
proper perspective
so that it is offers this
jordan married analogy
he in
paragraph seven
he said own voyage when your boat had banker
if your ticket
less water
you think about small selfish
can a vegetable by the way
but you must keep you want fixed on the don't
and we'll go round frequently in case attacking call
if you carl
you must what all those other things belts
so you will not be
well now the ship like life
the ideas
sure go mad
in julie staff in the world
but don't let yourself back attacks
when i need your prior year comes
keep things being a word or in your mind
what he continues this he is how great these seem like
you not had a relate to shelf ish
and
tomatoes
this is howard isn't like you i'm putting again
if you are given a white
and each what
instead of a beds doubling the small selfish
that should not
he near you either
what did it happen pools
let all things go and write to the boat with it
out
turning back
i was strategies that you have available for you
for do you would think this
chris trench it's you recognize
and adopt bill was attitude towards things whose trenches
he is painful
to you
when your job wakes he says you say that it bought a broken job
when you war
child is lost
say
that is bought a lost
china
do you say
he is
the lot of coal
consequence
ah be outlook that i being
presenting to you
around
he gets
it's something really good
when it was the serenity prayer
it's think pretty good
at the grocery store
it's not is pretty disturbing
when it fell wife
and
child
what do you think
that's going
on
i leave that for you as a question
and turn it now looks
feud
the second day
that the red
we're today
oh great work
composed
he in the sixth
century
in around five twenty four
why have somebody who's not trajectory blank
also
inwardly
to the way that at that fetus is dead
i kiss you were call with warrants
wait
and try to make sense
all of my thugs
the ruins
outs offering
once he became free
don't see us by contrast
i was born into a noble family
what's enormously successful politically in his early years
i'd choose i used to went on to be
enormously successful political figures
i
he hands later years
moscow
in three send
for
treason
an beak how consolation of philosophy was one of the most
why did the dragon reproduced
works
all eats
and i it was ready for centuries and centuries by almost everyone
we have gorgeous illuminated menus

the story
so in this one here is a week he is

we
figure that calls
philosophy
to share it's philosophy
come to visit but we see us
e. u.
he is
i'm what i philosophy sadness
you pm
he is
in many ways
like what happened tedious was talking about
there he is she says
a wheel
while the
fortune
sometimes things start off badly
batter up
sometimes things start off better
and get back
what do you hooking evidently
being a circle
to what comes to you
and to what these
taking
prom
you
and recognizing
that derek he is
nothing
to be got
other than to recognize that these
he is the pattern that life
he is
to bowl week he is
enormously
liberated
reckon i think
that
what gold along with
pena sees the possibility of using them
alice him to come to terms
we if
the race
on having lost
all that
c.
previously hack
what i wanted beauty and the final faction of all the lecture
easy to return to a theme that we dis
gossip
previously
question at all what philosophical utility their eased
works
during times of dicks
stream to rest
sol
my hope
cause you
rag
i had
that even if you don't recognize this settlement
can guess who he is
mrs admiral james stock elk
who was

after rejecting i have
thirty seconds to make my laugh
freedom
before i mended
in the main street of a little village right to hide ants
so help me out i whispered to myself
five years down here at least
i'm leaving the world of technology and entering
the world love
many pack hand
he says now quoting from the handbook
many a hand from the entry beyond the handbook
i ejected from that airplane happened decade from that airplane
juan
opening paragraph that we read a few moments ago
i'm spending that is still what
always keep
second files in his mind for a
those things that are apple can be
those things that are not happy him in other ways
saying that seth backed out
those things that are with any that work
and those things
that are beyond his power
to win either way it's thingy
those things that are beyond that did not that it's free will
and though was that lie beyond it
oh ahmed things
over which you do not have control
which being a contacts
all tortured imprisonment
are a huge number
ah
after that
hey he says stop dale
it will do you tenth
here and then of the i. a. b.
yet i am convict them

thought
that there was things will change
however
and this is crucial
everything in category eighties

he said us
when torture it
what we actually did what and released from the torture what we contemplated
whilst
that we had engaged in a certain sort all that
frail all the ourselves them always
it was then that i'm learned watts
no we cart
how close the moral harm that we talked about
when we discussed the jonathan she work
a shoulder broken a bone in my backdrop into a leg broke into place work
she heights
in comparison
i think he is
look i'm not for any great don't harm than this
drawing the trustworthy
self respect ing
well behaved marin the u.

sid you a chance of extravagant
that forces people

and when children some depths
found selves cute
thing is that day
ballot
what paul said
two of them
they shivered
a shock
they felt ideas order in their souls
here again is an answer to
lyle cons
challenge
but notice
that
those
stop the ellie eased
you on board much of the addict
he's you don't think
the baby about
to miguel
