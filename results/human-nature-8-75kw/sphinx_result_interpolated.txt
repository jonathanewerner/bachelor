iii today's lecture
ears
us duran the he in the philosophical tradition
that books not act the way in which
human endure connected yes
can provide
meaning and the possibility for flourishing
but what's looks rather act us
sort
love
the logical detachment
ask away a
dealing with a
the inevitable
toots
all lived its
very its
and
very sexy can nation at all the outlook that will be considering today
in the context
the western tradition
can be found in the writings
all the philosopher
here is all wonderful
imaginary portrayed on him
from seventeen fifty
who
setting added table
ce monthly wiki is
paying
to use to walk
salt
his name
as you don't found the reading guide
epictetus
lived ad
the beginning called
to millennium go he made latin the from
if key
to one thirty in the common ella he was born it being
greek speaking
asia minor
and
was that spent life living ii the roman empire during that era
only portion all his white has

here's some decide as to whether
tell the h of
team
or until the age of twenty seven biting indicates a significant portion of iv white
with spent
beans
bravery
by prematurely gained free benefits
o. point
either before or after gaining freedom
he started
bill works
and
philosophical outlook
all the tradition
known
ask
so is says
and the works that were produced
aw and see if the happen http survive
are to
the first is a major of
for volume
collection
ahmed kings discussion some full range of topics
questions ii medicaid thinks the way that
questions about the way the world is questions indicates the mala th
how does should understand world
and also questions in ethics
and edition to back
has survived beats
to ordinary bulk
that we read for today
the little
forty five at the graf
s a
known as
the handbook
which was
so there's that ill
through the recorded by one of epictetus is
students
preserved
you got wet
now noble and that epictetus produced in the context of the handbook
was an enormously influential for most of the two thousand years
back to highs
being part of the western tradition
you to a killer this
what is
he's
that i used to show you up http sure that
easy drawn pp
from
the library
ah
not not there
benjamin
adams
the second president of the units
who happiness book
iii he is
collecting
iii
iv
seventeen fifty
full of
latin
edition
wait till their eclipse
i'm not are you think
you to know historically about
the volume that were reading
first don't translation operate
what in fact
don by
a great
eighteenth century woman of letters
a list of if carter
the the translation that we are reading he is
a more modern
versions of that
so ne us work epictetus
john many called book
can its
pp
doses
so we think introduced in this class of for
first to the writings
all played all
who he is a systematic philosopher in his views about everything
and his commitments are to a certain kind of
rational list formal its
idea list philosophy
i'm reading introduced
to the works
style aristotle
through one
ah please
writings
the
to mccain ethics
oh ii bonus
to tradition the time tradition in the with jillian tradition
ancient philosophical world produced
i not all other ce
to mac
how books that had use about
almost
any question you could acts
among those was the v you know ads
stoics is
so ce oats how
we've missed
you
underlying medical facts
about reality
don't move to
he itself
he is but
organic
physical to a talented
the to governed by what they called locals
work divided reasons
there he is
on order
to
the world
that activists how can believed on human beings
given that
he is tomb
called today
you look kind all
virtue bond us don't picture
e. s.
act think nina a pool are a
we've what resume tells you
nature good man
iv ghali not along we a
pace
grand scheme of things
i'm not trying
fight against
what is
free divine
for
you
so it's your to prior thing that
elements
all pp the stoic tradition
get haidt ah
being subsequent
do you think
traditions
in some ways the stoic of you
that the world is all well ordered and take
governor by divine reasons
lived active hard
all
maybe
all
the religious traditions that are familiar to you today
the question then becomes what he is demanded of your perspective what sure to you do
give these to things are the case
i what us stoics suggest is that you need to its
that
ii is the consequences
ah but pow work and goodness of the logo ce even though the week in which it is good for you maybe
on available to you
c
i am back in order to do so you need to moderate are desirous
you need to avoid acts
emotion
and verified
i'm to act
the in the accord week reasons
so the contemporary you said the terms
stoic one who
that aches
press offering in the face of paying
he not
on this
think of these pp
i think good to recognize that
how made
all of the philosophers that we reading a
this is part of systematic world v
the ag is not need to a little bit here and a little bit there
and we don't worry about pp
yeah see if they haven't
idea about the nature
fundamental nature of reality
of you about how we know that
and then he was about what we ought to do as a consequence
now i see this
he in the handbook
is concerned
only with a small portion all the stoic pitcher
he's concert
basically
when writing
the very first
self
manual
he's trying to tell you
mr org is
as saying
all of
ancient
roman world in about
the year
what true joan if you would like
and here is what tells you you need to get
you need to mind how to was
on appropriately to experience
by doing three things
you need to alter your purse axes
of the war also that you come human apprehended things in such a way
they don't
influence you
harmful week
you need to altered or desirous
with respect
to the world
i a unique
chance
clap sure you war like
in such a way
she's staying august
great and now
need to ce tractor socially issues
in ways that will how who
spring
a commitment
i don't next strike a minute
how can you read
rumor the tax
how
i suggested ways all bloody each of this
it is
bob the bulk
into one of these categories
so now example when epictetus
how have
that we need to alter our perception of the world
your that we specific waves that he thinks we might
go about doing it
contents
to this
instruction
the first is that we need to pp
highly classified things
each you categories
things over which we have control
more about that in a moment
i'm things over which
don't have control
so we need to jacked our tax
china needs
down
we need also
anticipate
no may the world
please i'm full works
so we do not don't you know what effect one what is that to us
but i'm not things that aren't up to us
we need says structured our expectations inside to wait
that we are emotionally prepared
for what will befalls
and again
more about that in the couples
life
i we need to recognize
in some ways this is a some point of the first
the wall back
judgments
police
why a
we determining
whether iv he is the case
that experiences
a fax
so those are three things that epictetus says we need to
do with wrists
get out of examples of
are
each of them in a moment
edition would like to us
thing that we need to
he don't we need to carlton make appropriate
drives
need to get are desiring lined up with the world in such a way that we are its
first
i know we need you this
he is by converting
added relation
queen desire
and the world
usually a
desirous
graf
a way things
aunt
lecture wish they were
i desiring for only yesterday
but their not be
the snow day in three weeks
for my children
what the world refused
cooperate
on back
questions
hackett if that adjusted my desires
the world
i desiring that things go want exactly as able those
good
then i would have the a
contents
make their presence
in my office
this i think that
hume
he in
tragic to i think
do you says it's
to ordinary feeling capacity
to a silly things from one categories
things pp
from
another
so now i showed you
the way ce in selection task
anything which had
i
a and a half
and of four and a sad end
and a half can which cardinal haidt of turnover to
truly whether it was true
that isn't a on one side
there's a seven on the other
doin' that
half
was
part
what wish you to vanity structure only identical to another task
pack
obtain show war cards
which had each is
alcoholic or not alcoholic drinks
and a after which cards you need
turnover
to verify true that if somebody ease drinking a beer
then she is over twenty won
all three wiki able to i'm nervous then
the difficult problem
you like all the problem with respect to which you had
i see it is points not to was that we have
don't sack
for letting go
we have a skill sacked
for
the logical
we epictetus that for think
stop happiness
any document
i'm what he figure we do when the dental give an example of this
to learn not to us
certainly
the finger which we find
are to let the wealth
to the things which we find it easy
collect a lot
and there i ebooks
floyd his capacity that we have
for metaphor it
understanding
certainly in this category epictetus concepts in pp
ah habitually be are soft
the indebted ability
all the loss
here's some bad news for all of you
you world
when to die
shall the key dan happening prior
course about this
about coming to terms
we it these inevitable fact about human existence
but epictetus sid don't
why
i own is on board
profoundly
in a way that the facts
to you
not just
the latin love
the able to utter the words
i've will die some day
but the level of we lead
habitually
to you or relations to things
oh seven
things that seemed incredible ii
important
move
last of
for the
epictetus a points out the importance
few points
you
in ways that mind pp
through the norm ce your culture
you what some you latin the to pointed yet
nay keep its social feedback
somehow creature active traffickers
describes the importance
all the resisting social pressure
when people say are you
you are seeking honoring gloria you must be a loser
epictetus sense
lap and face now
they're not what they say
about two
and at that point acts
year
they are almost gifts
mean packages that
five
john to
really
bce give you a kind a trick
so they once you to call to the
most to be
kind of silent
able say stop and you just
calmly
the respond
style this
strategy
that he's presenting to ask
to remain parts
am i doing the next
although lecture is to run through some ce
examples
obvious
looking first act epictetus is tax
according it direct week
and then
yeah things some contemporary and wants
the white these that epictetus is talking about
so they don't paragraph
ah that the key pieces handbook
the is one of the most
famous
all philosophical writing
in the western tradition of the last two thousand years that began sense olive
something interact to laugh
some things are not act
last
are up do your accept hence
and are impulse is
our desires our versions
in short whatever he's are only doing
i'm not are not up to
last
any is the the coal
gods nor are can
it is
our reputation as our public office the is
whatever it is not our and do it
now his canada lining points out
a mistake you can make
the finn a actress are by nature of
read a and hundred and i mean bce
need in where is the things that are not up
wise
and that means blade
hundred and not are kings
what do you think that things that are naturally in slate
that are not up
see you
oh no your own if you think think naturally in slater of
free
would that things that are not your own are your who
you will be
from what if
miserable
up sack
and walking round leaving the world for everything that
going wrong with
the midst think ah
do you think
that over which you hackett troll
and that over which you lack
cool
needs to
what a b
upset
miserable
relating s
i cooked craft keeping these categories
late
brings the greatest
cries
iv you think that only one easy worry says you works
annette what is not your ponies not your own
i
no one will ever a worse you
no one will ever him variable blame no one he was not
use anyone
you do not us
single thing and willingly it
because think oh things over which use
i happen to fall
what are the things over which
you actually to have control
i never consequences no one can course you
because you're only concerned about the things that are opt
the you
no one can hear you
b consul nobody can get in a way at all the things that are
now
do you
who has experience with
a frannie
or relative
when acquaintance
who has taken part being
one that bald
the many
contemporary versions
epictetus
in the for modest out
progress
knows that at the hard love the contemporary to
well bce that
lived
a version all this epic
what
what to elite incurred more most likely
first
i run would need
and that is
as a renegade prayer
which you can find
decorated
humming birds
and
yeah fidel ce god grant me the serenity to accept the things i can act
changed
courage to change the things that happen
and wisdom
to know the difference
if morning glorious archer style you can find it decorated
dole
or and angel
or a young child
you can find it
on a bowl
own most striking we
you can find the
how can be
plenty of are are
for your style
or your side
still
do you very these
think he in yet
next need is tomb the contemporary
mind
i think ce to mccain own way
that when i good and will indicates
for serenity prayer
i've found
how does and thousands of images like this
he in any language you can
think up
so this i don't that we needed does
think wish
between things that we can change in things that would tear
and that and active ebooks
we're think how to and although effort
is what's appropriate towards things that we can
he is a latin that hackett
he gets
has
offered
to
the western tradition
second example epictetus how class
a body may what is
ah a motion regulation
the room
anticipating what we'll
in cgsc
you
in a particular set
so he sat
oh you are going to gold
tomb
the bats
when you are not i some sort of action seven that yourself what sort active eadings
you could take a bath
what hoa your mind
what happened to have
less their people and jonathan pp
there people were in so think
don't v airport
what
benefit bleeding a long line
parrot for the fact each its
reading they are needing to wait for your take it
you can a jock

what to take a back
i wanna go to the up more
i whites you walk across the

week ii is
not up
skim the
i don't quite believe it
something which does not

very faint epictetus suggests
you
you see to what not is
that what he is

are not
things that happened a
but not them
