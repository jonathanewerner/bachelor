last last we talked about the brain
now what pablo that
about some foundations
so today
and monday
when i talk of a two very big ideas
in these ideas are associated
with
sick man
freud
and b. f. skinner
and i psychoanalysis and behaviors
and i want to talk about psychoanalysis
today
and behaviors next week
now one of these things
one of the things that makes
the russo interesting
mr skull
mom
most of the work women talk about in this class most of the ideas are narrow
so if not with some would is out somebody's idea
of a racial prejudiced
tom the best not to rewind rejected
will talk about theories of schizophrenia
but they're not tom
explanations of sexual effectiveness
most theories are specialized there is
with these two views are a rat
we're each to theories of everything
unconscious in just about everything that matter
david a life child a woman mental illness religion war love
freud and skinner had explanations for all of the
at this is not a history course
i have zero interest
in describing historical figures and psychology
just for the sake telling about because you feel
what i wanna tell you about though
is i wanna talk about these ideas
you so much rest on
and even want for dimly
on
a lot of these ideas have critical influence
on how we think about
the present
and that's that
now
for better or worse
we live in a world profoundly affected by satan
freud
if i had to ask you
choose a psychotic not need famous psychology
bastard
most to be freud
mom
he's the most famous psychologist ever
the senate profound influence
on the twentieth and twenty first century
palm
some vibe rapid information he was born in a fifties
spend most of his life and i
the and i
austria
then down but he died in london
in the escape of london
soon after training there at the beginning of war were to
as in axes began to occupy
where he lived
he's one of the most famous dollars ever
but he's not known for any single discover
instead is known for to development
of an unconscious the theory of mind
i'll
one of the develop over the standard many decades
tom
he was
in this time makes
it really while
a celebrity recognize on the street
it's road is likely was a man of its
fort mary energy about activity
calm
in part because he was very serious cocaine addicts
but also just in general emerge as a high energy sort of person
he was out for the nobel prize
in medicine and in literature
didn't get either one of
didn't get the prize in medicine as albert einstein
everybody was albert einstein
while the minds been really
road wrote a letter
say after opinions of other nobel prize
we're letter saying
don't get the price freud
he doesn't deserve a nobel prize each is a psychologist
the acts
okay
ah
while he's almost
universally a claims
as a profound in board intellectual figure
is also the object of considerable dislike
mom this is in part because of his character
he was not a very nice man in many ways
he was deeply ambitious
to the cause of promoting psychoanalysis
the because present in his view
in defending it
on
and he was some
often dishonest
freely brutal too was friends
and i know terrible to his enemies
it wasn't interesting carrot my favorite freuds
laurie
was
as he was levy europe
you're in a rise of the nazis
as he was ready to go
to voting when
from mom id either germany or austria

he had to sign a letter from the to stop focus stop will each and
a intercepted
and demanded he signed a letter saying
that at no point in the been threatened
or harassed by the stop
so he signs the letter
in any rates under need that
because stop goes not armenian anyway
that highly recommended to stop with everybody
is this
he had a certain aggression
to him
ah
it was also is also disliked
often hated
because of his views
he was seen as a sexual renegade
freud the conception of
of people
as good an ration pure beings
amen when and that's these rose to power the nineteen thirties
he was identified as a to
who was devoted to just
drawing the most sacred notions
candidate
and in many aches
some extent
pomp many people see in this way
and a some extent
on this accusation have some truth to it
mom
freud made claims about people
that many of us
maybe most of us would rather not now
well okay
what in the sec
well
if you as somebody
who doesn't like freud what he said gold
mom and in fact freud said are a lot of things
some of which mom
we're not very rational
for instance on
he's well known for his account
phallic symbols arguing certain architectural monuments
are are
about
sub consciously developed as
you know representations
bomb
unrelated to this he development for each theory penis envy
penis envy isn't isn't that an account of the development
they
that everyone of you list
the layout has gone through according to freud
and ideas that you discovered
at some point you development the lacked a penis
mom
this is not this is a catastrophe
and so each of you
in for
at that point
they you had been cast faded you had once
tom
happiness
the somebody had taken it from you

you then
turn to your father
and love your father
because your father has a penis
so uses are penis substitute
come
you reject
your mother
julio unworthy do dover
penis lack
and
that shapes your psychosexual development
about that sort of thing you know about freud your not them have very high opinion
him
oral does work
but
at the core of freuds explanation
the maureen to resting ideas
is this
as a setup claims
of the man's intellectual important
and the two main ones are that's the two main ones involve existence
of an unconscious
unconscious motivation
and the notion of unconscious dynamics
for unconscious
which lead to mental illnesses
dreams
focus of the tom and sell
the first id at the id of unconscious motivation
mom
involves rejecting
the claim
but you know what you're doing
so supports you fall in love right
and use id one american
and as somebody was asked to ask you walk
then you'd say something like well
i'm ready to get married a stage of my life i really love
martin attractive at one have kids
whatever
then maybe
this is true
but a freud in might say
the that this is your honest
you not want
anybody else
still
on
there are desires and motivation said governor behavior
but you may not be aware of
mom
so
in fact
you might wanna mary john
tom because he reminds you of your fall
or because you wanna get that somebody for be trained
on
somebody was just
kill you this
it's a best total nonsense
but that would teach her or forty and affording would say that these processes are on
so course you just don't know what's happening
so the radical idea year is
you might not know
why why you to
what you get
and this is something we accept the things that visual perception
we except a you look around the world and you get sensations in you figure
here's a here's a card is that free this
a new does unconscious about this happens
but
it's unpleasant
and kind of frightening
this could happen
it this good
up why did things like why you now studying it yale
why you feel the way you to

now
the marriage cases six
free
but freud gives a lot of simpler examples
with a sort of unconscious
motivation
might play a role
so have you ever like somebody or dislike and not not know why
id ever found yourself in a situation where you're
you're doing something
or you're arguing for something
or making a decision
for reasons that you can't
holy articulate
have you ever for god somebody's name
at exactly the wrong time
have you ever call up the wrong name in the throats of passion
this is all
the freud be an unconscious
the ideas that we do these things these things are its
plain
cobb and of systems that were not aware out
now all of this would be fine
if you're unconscious was a reasonable rational computer if you unconscious was
really smart
and looking at for your best interest
what according to freud
that's not the way a worse according to freud
there are three distinct roses is going on here at
and these aren't violent internal on
and away you act in a way you think
products not of the c. you were
rational being
but of a set of conflicting creatures
and is remarks
are that it
the ego
and a super ego
and a emerge development all a
they did according to freud
present at birth
it's the at now part of self
it wants the eat drink
people
get warm and at sexual satisfaction
it is filled reduce please
it work so what freud called pleasure prints
it wants pleasure
annette wants it now
and that's according to freud
how human begins
purity it
freud had this wonderful phrase
polly mortars perverse it
your desire pleasure
now unfortunately like doesn't work like that
what you want
isn't always what you get
and this leads to a set of reactions
hope the fact
that pleasure isn't always year would you want
either
by planning have a satisfied are desires
who are
planning
have a suppressed of
in this system is known as the ego
or the self
and it works
on
on the reality principle
and id a
it works on
principle trying to figure out a
how to make your way through the world
how to satisfy your letters or
some cases how to give up on
and the ego tub emerges of the ego
for freud
symbolizes
fortune of consciousness
finally
this was all there was
it might be a simpler world
but freud had a third component
that of the soup re
and a super ego
is the internal wise rules of
parents in
by
so what happens in the course of development is
it is trying to make it way through the world as satisfied as
fires
but sometimes you're punished
for the
some desires are inappropriate
some actions
are wrong
in your punished for
the ideas that you come out the
you get in your head
a superego a conscience
in these movies id be like a little angel about it that
tells you
when things are wrong
and basically yourself the ego
the in between
they did
and superego
one thing to realize
i told you hate is a rages thinks
it just as all
hungry phone sex
all list get war all
the summer ego
is also stupid
the superego court reporters not some
brilliant moral philosopher
tell you are right now
is superego sick
and you should be ashamed of yourself
knowing that all
and in between these two screening creatures wannabe one of them
telling you cedar desires other one telling to be ashamed of yourself
is you
is the ego
now according to freud
most of this is unconscious
so we say a bubbling up id atop me feel
very https
ourselves
and a driving of the id the forces of the id in the forces of
are unconscious
in that
we cannot accessed
we don't know what
psycho working as a lot of our
kidneys or are standards
you can't deep respect and find them
rather they do their work
without conscious knowledge
now fright
develop this is is the freud you to reading in in broad outline
he extended it
and develop it into a theory
of psychosexual development
and so freuds theory is as i said before
there it everyday life
a decisions of the errors of falling a lot
is also theory child development
so freud believer five stages
personality development
it each is associated but
skinner erogenous
zone
and freud believe as well
that if you have a problem at a certain stage of something goes wrong
you'll be stuck there
support of freud are people in this room are what they are
because a cuts
in oral stage toward anal stage
and and
that's not
so bill will stages we start up
the mouth is associated with pleasure
everything is out being in chewing and so on
ah
and the problem for freud is
grave nurture weaning of a child
driving him of the brass
on
could lead to serious problems
in this personality about
it could make him
as a phrase go
goes into an oral person
and as or rowdy could be on
friday literally
it freud uses has next nation why somebody might eat too much
or chu got
or smoke
they're trying to achieve satisfaction
through them out
of a sort they didn't get
in this very early stage of development
but also be more asked
i'm if your roommate is dependent in need the
you could then go to remains a
your oral worse
the first year of your life did not go well

a phrase even more popular
is there anal stage
and that happens after oral stage
and problems can emerge
mom
if toilet training is not around
if you have problems during those years of liking to become
and anal
personality
mom according to freud your roommate it's a
your problem is
year to eighteen
and
core do freud literally
a man
your unwilling to part with your own
calm
to written down
oh
then and away manifests itself as you know just how people talk is
clean used in g.
this is the anal person out
then it gets old that
more complicated
on the next phase of the phallic stage at birth
with year
focus of pleasure of
shifts to the generals
mom
and bomb
patient
can lead to excessive masculinity
in females
warren fifty been nails
or
female need for attention or dominate
now at this point
something really interesting happen
call it oedipus
complex
this is based on the story
the medical story of the key
who killed his father
and married his mother
and according to freud this happens to all of us
in in this work
while all of us by all of us
freud man
man
mom
there's idea
years three or four years old
you're in the ballots
so what you interested well year addressed the venus
ah
and then you seek units
perot are object
freud sort of big about this but you know
you seek some sort of satisfaction
pool is out there
who'll be sweet and kind and loving and wonderful
well
mom
set a trial of four can first mom is nice
well mom
so far so primes as exact
oh boy falling in love with mother
rob
dad said
pump
now
now this is gonna get progressive we will but i want to
father
to the two sons
both sides when to a phase where dates
was of the set
they wanted to marry mummy in the
it's a name that happened be that when it worse than world
so
so so orders this
but now
get it gets a lowell that aggressive so set ideas a child afternoons
then he's going to kill his father
every three and we're with thinks
on but then because children a quarter freud dont map
sense of

the boundary between are mine
in the world
which is is a problem the problem is
is they don't get a think their father
can tell
that are plotting to kill
and they figure father's now angry at
and then they asked themselves
the worse thing dad to do to me
masters
castration
f. sewed a they come to the conclusion
father is going to castration
because are the a list of low
for the mom
and then they say
that's
an adult think about sex
for several years
and that the latency stage
the latency stages
they've got news use them of mom and dad
so love mom
one of the kill my father
that is gonna castration a
fellow love of mom
at this sex business
and it sex is repressed
until you get the genital stage
and a general stages
this stage we are all
the healthy
adults
mom
now that you're adults than you've gone through all the development
where would you stand united of the woods yet
because
unconscious mechanisms still
even if you haven't got fixated or anything
mom
there's still this dynamics
going on all the time
would you hate your ego in your shivering
mom and idea is
you superego remember his superego is
so you superego isn't only telling you
not to that fact
telling you not think that
so what's happening is a
years year did
is setting up oldest we're six
all of these crazy sexual and while desire
all out kill
oh i'll have sex with that
how
i'll have
to helping some i deserve
and
then
you superego
you soon reducing
no no no
in this that is repressed
doesn't even make it consciousness
the problem is freud at a very
hi can while likes
to re
of what goes on
and some other stuff slips out
and it shows up in dreams
shows up in slopes of hong
and in exceptional cases shows absurd
clinical
symptoms
so what happens is
freud describe a lot of normal life
as in terms of different ways we use
to keep that horrible stop from the it
making its way to consciousness
any call these
defense mechanisms
you defending yourself
again though
horrible parts
of yourself
as some of these make a little bit of sex
i mean one way to describe this
in a non technical non freud in ways
there's certain things about are suffering rather not
a certain desired rather not know
and we have ways to hide
so prisons are sublimation
sublimation is
you might have a lot of energy
maybe sexual energy or aggressive energy
but instead of turning into a sexual or aggressive
are get
we do is you focus it in some other way
sync imagine a great artist like picasso
turning sexual energy into is are
there is a bomb
there's displacement
displacement is calm
you have certain shameful thoughts are designers
and you re focus them more appropriate
a boy is bullied by his father
mom
they've hate his father
and one i heard
this is is that this is very shameful and difficult
the boy mind state
the doc
it's think he hated up
because that's a more acceptable to part
mom
there's projection
projection is
i have certain on concerned impulses i'm uncomfortable
so rather than own them myself
i project into somebody else
a classic example for freud
homeless sexual desires
mom
the ideas that i feel this tremendous loss
ford's you
and
need any the only

and
and
i'm ashamed of the slots
so wrestling senate
hey are you best looking at me the sexual manner
i you lasting after me
of
because what i do it i take my own desired
and freud suggested
perhaps mom all the way
that man who believe other men
who are obsessed with the sexuality of other men
our themselves
projecting away their own such
cyrus
there's rationalization
tom which is that when you do something are think something back
you ration wise a you give it a more
socially exceptional explanation
ah a parent who enjoys
smack in his child
will typically not say i enjoy smack in my child rivals that
for the child good
idea good and by doing this
and finally there is regression which is returning to an earlier stage of development
can you actually see this in children
in times
of stress
prom wow
bill become younger
the lack pm
they might friday night soccer thumb
get a blanket
so
now
these are all mechanisms that for freud are not the slay this bit pathological
there part of normal life
normally we do these things
to keep an equal liberty
among the defense systems of them caught
sometimes it doesn't work
sometimes things go all right
and what happens is
phrase it's not currently use in psychology
it was popular during freuds time
mom
hysteria
hysteria includes phenomena like
hysterical blindness mr pool deafness which is when you cannot
cannot year
even though there's nothing physiological wrong with you
all
paralysis trembling panic attacks
gaps of memory freudian regions
and id a is
that these are actually symptoms
these are symptoms of mechanisms going on
keep things
unconscious
it's a common enough idea movies
often in movies what happens on a goes to adults
that's an oral problem
they can't remember something
what a https insert a black yeltsin zone
and i list
pulls them zone
and at one point
begin is insight
any realize what what why they wanted
why they can
and for flight this is what happens
freud originally
to get
these memories out
through hypnosis
but then moved to the mechanism of free association
and according to freud ideas
patients offer resistance
on
to this
and mom and and idea but psychoanalysis
is
to
on
get over to resistance
and help patients
get insight
key notion of of of psychoanalysis
you're problems
are actually on
reflect the burr phenomena
you're hiding something from yourself
and once
you know what's going on deeper phenomena your problems
and let even example of a therapy session
that this is not a freud in analysis
will discuss later on the course what a freud in analysis
is
the does not appear for enough and forty mouth is words wine and
does not seated therapist if there is is very non racked of
bought
i'm gonna present this as an example here
because illustrates
so many of
freudian beans
particularly themes boat dreams
importance of dreams
about repression and about hidden meaning
so this is from a television episode
and the characters many some of you may obscene as many you want that
characters suffering
panic
mom
in particular yes panic attacks
when he sees these
first panic attack originated
what he wants with swimming pool
family about
fly away
annette panic
part high heart pounding
sweating
flushed
the past that
and is panic attacks through worse and worse
in philly sock there is
when the prescribe any medication
and this is
yes is one of is one of the meetings he had
with the therapist
freuds contributions extend beyond
how
that individual psychology an individual pathology
mom
freud have a lot to save a dreams
ties you to see in this illustration
the bullied the dreams hat mom
a manifest continent
meaning
manifest meaning way use
various under
but dreams always have awakened content as well leading
the hidden
implication of thing
he viewed old dreams as wish fulfillment
every green you have to certain wish you had
even though might be a forbidden way
the when wish to have
why have
ah
and dreams that
out in this isn't id along creative
freud
dreams had symbolism
things in dreams
we're often not
the rather symbols for other things
tom
freud believe the literature
to repay ills
stories to children and
and like
on
carrying
mom
certain
universal themes
certain aspects of unconscious
troubles
uncertain
preoccupied haitians of our unconscious mind
freud had a lot save a religion
a
for instance
by the viewed
a large
part of our
of the id of finding a singular all powerful blot
as c. your father figure
the some of us never hat
occur development
what a wanna spend the rest of the class
on
is the scientific assessment of freuds awaited was
far as the old you
freud had to say in broad outline
i don't wanna take on
time
to consider whether or not we should leave this
and how will it fits
for more
find
before doing so on
i'll take questions for few minutes
above freud are freuds duties
yes
sense some question a question isn't
conflicts
pool of element
primes
is it is
always assumes that a child as a mother and father
one of each uncertain toward of the millie all's
an
the question then is
what of a child raised by single pair
for example
what of the trial was never rest that
bob must are
and calm
and
freud is have had problems
freud
freud was very
focus
on family life of the people the interactive with
brother popper class to
and and these are the questions would've been difficult
answer
i imagine that what a freud in would have to say as you would expect systematic differences
so you would expect
child
which is grow up a mother this will be a father of five of
to be in some sense psychological
and
by that
they can go through the normal
yes
ah the issue the question is
do modern psychoanalytic
outs still believe that women
do not have super he goes
on
freud was was as you point me out
korea's for pointy
annette women
ah
or morally him ensure
relative to men
i think freud would say that women had super you goes
it is not the sort of
thirty ones that man that
how
i think psychoanalysis psychoanalytic
dollar trade now the next
some would maintain edu really are deep sex differences
others would wanna janice in
that aspect for
yes
what sublimation is
a lot of these is a good question question is the tubes were wet is sublimation have is a
other
fans madness
a lot of defense mechanisms
how
involved taking a desire
and turning it
now what displacement does is
takes it
from you
kirk
like i'm angry at you but maybe that's for been for some reasons
ah
what projection does is takes a desire from the
and and puts it on somebody else reading
and what sublimation does is it just
gives out the details and keeps energy
so you stay out you know you roommates face up all night work
and you say your roommate for instance on
that's just because
you haven't had sex in long
anyone have sex
to do a warrior energy
you're back to
and then
in a music that's
sublimation
i love that interests i
a new reviewed very please
tom one more one more question
yes
the question is which is related to the issue
standing the issue of the two pair first
about
to what extent
are these notions ballot id crossed cultural
and as such a good question nominate me for my popper myth units
that's actually
that's the to the issue
up
the scientific assessment
of for
so much reading get your question
funnel that
ah
freud
freud in theory
is
now at this point in time
extremely controversial
mom
and
there's a lot of well known criticism
and attacks on freud
is it is that units one book
ah
on the memory worse by frederick
crews
which i'm and frederick cruisers winners
strongest
and most passionate critics of freud
and
did problems will freud
mom
go like this
there are two ways you could rejected fear
there to problems with a scientific theory
mom
one waited rejected theory is that it could be wrong
so suppose i have a theory that
the reason why some children have boxes
up are found development was ordered
because are mothers to love them
does a popular theory
for many years
except
possible theory it just turns out to be wrong
but another way and and so one way to attack in addresses scientific
theory
is mom
is to view it as just to see whether or not a works
but there's a different problem with the re cut that
a theory could be sold they
and all unconscious or
that on that it can't even be test
and this is one of the main critics
freud
ah
the idea could be summed up by application from the physicist
wolfgang all
and polly was asked is opinion
of another physicist
holly said that's
that guy's work is crap
he's not right
he's not even long
annette criticism about freud its
is that he's not a wow
mom
the issue of anus
is some arise in a more technical way
by the philosopher
karl popper
who does drives
who believe reduce the term
by ability
the idea of also
thing which this i am
from non sign
is it scientific predictions
strong claims about the world
and
these claims are of a sort
couldn't be proven wrong
they're not
science
so for example in psychology
toward a claims will be entertaining for of
course
the clue claims like
dad wish to be him think that the campus
causes failures of certain sorts of memory
or every learned world
man on average
one have more sexual partners in when
or exposure to violence television
can to make children themselves more while
now
are they tour of a false will will talk about that
point here is
they can be thoughts
there interesting and not
tom
that they can be tested
and as such
they go they might be wrong
with a graduate level
of the scientific
do
i've
this should be contrasted with non scientific programs
and the best example of the non scientific program
is a strong legit
cromwell the straw poll after logical projection
is not that the wrong
is that they can't be around i'm not even
i did my vitamin horace go
today
on a wet
tom
a couple of negative ads that could make to open a keeper next few days
gonna watch that
presents a vote more than the message if you wanna blocks everything into
but keeping a piece of shaped
are core million close will help you keep in touch
with your fun side
starting this morning i got my wife will be civic i have been sort of intact my thoughts
the problem is
cute is identical by step
thought that was wrong
it can be wrong
it's a soul they
i got a better or spoke from the onion
on
right at all part of smoke moment handicap away to please offer
imagine all the character of this lets
that murder
now
that's
good projection
because
while it's give it turns out to be true
i must say those guys really nonstop
also viable
on
are you willie freud
sales that's
because freud been
theory
is often soul
they in flexible
that tenderly be tested in any reliable wait
a big problem of this is a lot of protein theories claimed be valid dayton course of psychoanalysis
so when you ask people what you believe in freud
they want sale because the this experiment that experiment this davidson addicts it was a is
freud affording very
